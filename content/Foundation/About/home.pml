<h1>
  The seL4 Foundation
</h1>
<div>
  <p>
    We have taken an exciting step to expand the seL4
    community, by setting up the <strong>seL4 Foundation</strong>,
    similar to foundations for other open-source projects, such as
    the Linux Foundation's Cloud Native Computing Foundation,
    RISC-V and others. It forms an open, transparent and
    neutral organisation tasked with growing the seL4 ecosystem. It
    brings together developers of the seL4 kernel, developers
    of seL4-based components and frameworks, and those
    adopting seL4 in real-world systems. Its focus is on
    coordinating, directing and standardising development of the
    seL4 ecosystem in order to reduce barriers to adoption, raising
    funds for accelerating development, and ensuring clarity of
    verification claims.
