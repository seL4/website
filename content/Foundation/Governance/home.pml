  seL4 Foundation Governance
</h1>
<div>
  <p>
    The <a title="seL4 Foundation"
       href="../">seL4 Foundation</a>&nbsp;is established as a
       project under The Linux Foundation. It is designed to
       fulfill the key principles described&nbsp;<a title=
       "seL4 Foundation Key Principles pdf"
       href="seL4_Foundation_Key_Principles.pdf"
       target="_blank">here</a>&nbsp;and summarised below.
  </p>
  <p>
    The seL4 Foundation has 2 parts:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The <strong>seL4 Directed Fund</strong>, governed by the <a title=
         "Governing Board"
          href="../Board">Governing Board</a>.
    </li>
    <li>The <strong>seL4 Technical Steering Committee</strong>, composed of the
      committers and contributors.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
<h2>
  Principles
</h2>
<div>
  <p>
    The seL4 Foundation is intended to be structured and governed
    to promote the following key principles:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Neutral and community-based</strong>. The seL4
      Foundation will provide a long-term, independent support for
      the seL4 kernel and the seL4 ecosystem, by enabling the
      collaborative community-based development, availability and
      adoption of the seL4 kernel. This includes providing a
      familiar structure (i.e., under The Linux Foundation) for
      membership and raising funds to support its activities, and
      building the community of developers, adopters, training, and
      expertise. The seL4 Foundation will aim to represent the
      perspectives of all main actors of the seL4 community (kernel
      developers, kernel verifiers, ecosystem developers and
      adopters) in the technical and general governance of the seL4
      kernel and the&nbsp;seL4 Foundation.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Grow adoption</strong>. The seL4 Foundation will
      enable and grow adoption of seL4 by supporting the evolution
      and verification of the seL4 kernel and supporting the growth
      of the seL4 ecosystem needed to ease the development of
      seL4-based systems.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Brand promotion and protection</strong>. The seL4
      Foundation will provide official releases of the seL4 kernel
      with clear associated verification statements, to promote the
      use of seL4 as a competitive advantage, with clear
      traceability to the sources of the code and the proofs.
    </li>
  </ul>

<h2>
  Governance Documents
</h2>
<div>
  <p>
    The seL4 Foundation is underpinned by 2 key documents: the
    <a title="seL4 Foundation Fund Charter"
       href="seL4_Foundation_Fund_Charter.pdf">seL4
      Foundation Fund Charter</a>, and the 
    <a title="seL4 Foundation Technical Charter"
       href="seL4_Foundation_Technical_Charter.pdf">seL4
      Foundation Technical Charter</a>. Both are modelled on
    the standard approach for Linux
    Foundation projects.
