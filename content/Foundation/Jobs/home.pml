      develop hypervisor functionality, you will become an expert in the open
      source ecosystems around Xen Project hypervisor, Linux, and the <b>seL4
      micro-kernel</b> as you gain advanced understanding of cutting-edge
      system-on-chips (SoC).  This position is located in Grand Rapids,
