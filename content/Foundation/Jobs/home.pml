 25 Oct 2021: HENSOLDT Cyber is looking for researchers in formal verification,
 cryptography experts, and software/hardware engineers with a focus on
  embedded Systems

    <b>Company description and position in seL4 ecosystem</b>:
    <p>
      HENSOLDT Cyber is a joint venture between Secure Elements GmbH and
      HENSOLDT Holding Germany GmbH. We are a founding member in the seL4
      Foundation and also member of the RISC-V foundation. Our mission is
      establishing a paradigm shift to cyber security, we advocate <b>secure IT
      instead of IT security</b>. We combine the know-how of more than one
      hundred years of experience in high-performance technology in the fields
      of defense and aerospace. We build systems that are secure from the ground
      up, combining innovative physical protection with mathematical proofs of
      software correctness to achieve true trustworthiness. We offer
      <b>Security Made in Germany</b>.
      <br>
      Optimized for use in industrial, aerospace and defense applications, our
      customers can expect high quality military-grade security, safety
      critical, user-friendly and flexible solutions. Our products have been
      designed to ensure the integrity of embedded systems at the core: the
      operating system and the processor.
      <br>
      The operating system TRENTOS is a revolution in cyber security based on
      the seL4 microkernel and CAmkES. We developed this highly secure operating
      system for IoT devices and cyber physical systems. seL4 provides strict
      isolation of components, with communication restricted to explicitly
      enabled channels, ensuring clarity of information flows. Mathematical
      proofs of implementation correctness of seL4 as well as critical
      components guarantee system integrity under all operating conditions.
      <br>
      Our MiG-V is a RISC-V based general purpose processor targeting
      high-security use cases. The core's logic encryption prevents the
      insertion of hardware trojans through production. Running seL4 from ROM
      prevents any kernel modifications to achieve ensures highest security
      levels.
      <br>
      The combination of MiG-V and TRENTOS gives HENSOLDT Cyber full control of
      the design and production chain. The MiG-V SoC can be used together with
      the formally verified seL4 microkernel hosted in the chip's internal ROM
      to create an ultra-secure solution.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Position details and link to seL4</b>:
    <p>
      In order to fulfill our mission, we are expanding our teams in Engineering
      (junior/senior level) and Research (PhD program and post-doc).
      <br>
      We are looking for the following profiles with focus on seL4 for our
