<p>
We are completing the implementation of a minimal, pure IPv6 network stack optimized to run on IoT endpoints connected to a network through a Layer 2 Ethernet interface. This implementation supports only the minimal set of protocols (IEEE 802.3, ICMP, IP, and UDP) to provide efficient UDP-based communication between an IoT endpoint and any other host.
</p>
<p>
We believe our implementation will provide high performance and reliability through a strict application of separation of concerns and elimination of all unnecessary data copies while keeping the codebase amenable to verification.
</p>
<p>
In this talk, we report on our progress implementing and verifying this networking stack.
