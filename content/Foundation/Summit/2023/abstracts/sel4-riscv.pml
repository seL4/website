    The use of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) is becoming increasingly common in the design of secure systems. TEEs provide a secure execution environment for sensitive applications and data, ensuring that they are protected from attacks and unauthorized access. TEEs are typically implemented as a separate execution environment within a system, with their own hardware and software resources that are isolated from the rest of the system. The trend towards the use of TEEs is driven by the increasing sophistication of cyber-attacks and the need for more robust security solutions. As such, the use of TEEs is becoming increasingly important in the design of secure systems, and technologies such as seL4 and RISC-V are playing a key role in their development.

    In this talk, we will present our efforts on using seL4 on RISC-V to build a TEE service. We will discuss the challenges we faced during the development process and the solutions we implemented to address them. Additionally, we will provide an in-depth overview of our TEE architecture by discussing its features and demonstrating its functionality through real-world use cases. Our experimentation tests with the PolarFire Icicle kit have played a crucial role in enhancing our understanding of the platform and refining our implementation. Furthermore, we will discuss our ongoing efforts to improve and expand upon the TEE service and its potential applications, as well as outline our future research and development directions in this domain.
