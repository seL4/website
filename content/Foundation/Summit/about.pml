  seL4 Summit 2022: Bids
</h1>
<div>
 <h3>
   Background
  </h3>
  <p>
   The seL4 Summit 2022 is the first to be organised by the seL4 Foundation. Established in 2020, the seL4 Foundation brings together developers of the seL4 kernel, developers of seL4-based components and frameworks, and those adopting seL4 in real-world systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   The first three seL4 Summits were organised by the <a href="https://trustedcomputingcoe.org/summits/">Trusted Computed Center of Excellence</a>, and were hosted in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   The seL4 Foundation now aims to host the summit on a different continent each year, as far as possible. For 2022, we therefore solicit bids from prospective hosts with a preference for location outside of North America.
  </p>

  <h3>
   Principles and process
  </h3>
  <p>
   There will be two separate bodies in charge of the summit: a Program Committee, in charge of the technical side (content, invited speakers, program...) and an Hosting Team, in charge of organising the event (venue, finances, catering, local arrangements...).
  </p>
  <p>
   More information on the Program Committee will come soon.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Hosting Team is selected through an open bid process by the seL4 Foundation board, after consultation with the community.
  </p>
  <p>
   The call for bids ideally occurs 2 months before the previous summit, in order for the bids for year N+1 to be presented at the summit in year N.
  </p>
  <p>
    We aim for a hybrid in-person/online events, pre-dominantly in-person, with the option of recordings of the talks being available after each summit. A back-up plan for a virtual event in case of pandemic-related travel restrictions should be defined as part of the bid application.
