        The talk gives an overview about what works more or less out of the box for ARM and RISC-V and what advances configuration and debug options can be used. Then we will look at the limitations of the various emulated machines and some pitfalls. Finally we will explain some of the modifications we have done to the QEMU sources, so it provides some otherwise missing features.
