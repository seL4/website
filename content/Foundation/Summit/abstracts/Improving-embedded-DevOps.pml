    While seL4 is an amazing technology, it is difficult to develop and build applications from scratch. Even when using virtualization, the development process for OS applications is a long loop of write, build, deploy, test, fix, build, deploy, test, etc. One way to improve on this is to borrow from the server world and support containers in VMs running on seL4. This improves embedded DevOps by allowing developers to test various container applications together on their host target, thereby reducing the number of required deployments. We will be discussing what work we have already done in this space as well as some thoughts on where to take it in the future. This will be a short talk followed by open discussion to explore issues and interests.
