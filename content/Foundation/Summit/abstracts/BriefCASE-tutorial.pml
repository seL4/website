As part of DARPA's Cyber Assured Systems Engineering (CASE) program, our team has developed a model-based systems engineering environment called BriefCASE that integrates formal methods at all levels of system design, including the ability to build systems targeting seL4.  In this hands-on session we will provide a top to bottom demonstration of the tools, transforming a system model to address cyber requirements, verifying the correctness of the model, generating component implementations from formal specifications, generating infrastructure code to run on seL4, automatically producing an assurance case documenting the design rationale, and running the final system in emulation on QEMU.  A virtual machine containing all necessary tools and models will be provided before the session.
