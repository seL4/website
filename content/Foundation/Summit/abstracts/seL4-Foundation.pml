    The seL4 Foundation is home to the ecosystem of software, developers and adopters for safety- and security-critical systems based on seL4. It was formed in April 2020 as a neutral and community-based organisation that ensures long-term, independent support for seL4 and its ecosystem, and fosters strong community participation and ownership in the ecosystem. It raises funds for continuing and accelerating development, facilitates interoperability, standardisation and sharing of cost for the benefit of all. Its aim is to ensure that seL4 is not only the worldâ€™s best secure operating-system technology, but is readily deployable and supported by a diverse and stable ecosystem of services and products.

    In this talk I will give an brief update on the Foundation's successes in increased contributions, increased support, and increased membership, as well as the vision to keep supporting a thriving seL4 ecosystem.
