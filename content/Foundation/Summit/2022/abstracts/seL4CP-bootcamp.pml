    The seL4 Core Platform (seL4CP) is a minimal Operating System built on top of seL4. It was designed to be simple enough that those without prior experience with seL4 can get started easily in building secure performant systems on seL4. seL4CP provides lean abstractions so that seL4 can be used for building reliable systems easily, without being restricted to a specific environment. This workshop will introduce you to seL4CP such that by the end, you will be able to build systems for your own purposes and know how to run them on hardware. We'll also give a brief overview of the internals of seL4CP to make it a little easier for participants to port seL4CP to their own hardware.
