    Formal methods tools that provide mathematical proof of system properties have improved dramatically in their power and capabilities. As part of DARPA's Cyber Assured Systems Engineering (CASE) program, our team has developed a model-based systems engineering environment called BriefCASE that integrates formal methods at all levels of system design, including the ability to build systems targeting seL4. We will present an overview of the CASE project and the capabilities of the BriefCASE tools. We will also describe an application of the BriefCASE tools and workflow to the mission computing system in a military helicopter.
