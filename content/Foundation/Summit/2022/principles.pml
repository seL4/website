  seL4 Summit 2022
</h1>
<h4>
Munich, Germany (hybrid), 10-13 Oct 2022
</h4>

<h3>
   Principles
</h3>

<div>
  <p>
    An open <strong>call for presentation</strong> invites submissions of short abstracts about cool work on seL4.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <strong>Program Committee</strong> is in charge of the technical content (reviewing submission, selecting invited speakers, defining the program).
  </p>

  <p>
      The <strong>Hosting Team</strong> is in charge of organising the event (venue, finances, catering, local arrangements).  <!--The Hosting Team is aimed to be selected through an open bid process by the seL4 Foundation board. The call for bids ideally occurs 2 months before the previous summit, in order for the bids for year N+1 to be presented at the summit in year N.-->
  </p>

  <p>
      The <strong>location</strong> is aimed to be on a different continent each year, as far as possible, with a hybrid in-person/online event.
