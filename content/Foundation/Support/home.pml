  Funding the next big steps for the seL4 project
</h1>
<br>
<p>
  Alongside growing the seL4 ecosystem, protect and promote the seL4 brand
  and provide longevity to seL4, one of the aims of the
  <a href="../">seL4 foundation</a> is to provide an avenue for
  funding on-going <a href="../../About/more-research.pml">research</a>,
  on-going engineering as well as sharing the cost of "big-ticket"
  verification items, through its membership revenue, and through specific
  fund-raising to address particular needs.
</p>
<p>
  <b> Together, we can change the world of critical systems,
    to achieve real security!
  </b>

  Support by joining
</h2>
<p>
  By <a href="../Membership/">joining</a> the adventure, you can support:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    the funding of an on-going support of the community, maintenance of existing versions,
    improvements of the infrastructure (in particular the automation of the seL4 verification
    framework), evolution of the kernel, and, importantly, development of the ecosystem.
  </li>
  <li>
    the funding of big-ticket items that are crucial to our aim of making seL4 ubiquitous.
    The biggest of these are:
    <ul>
      <li> <b> Verification of the 64-bit Arm kernel </b>
      </li>
      <li> <b> Verification of the multicore kernel </b>
      </li>
    </ul>
    The interest for these items is strong but the investment required
    is above the pain limit of most single organisation. The foundation
    provides a vehicle to pool investments to achieves these.

</ul>
