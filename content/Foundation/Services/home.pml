  <p style="padding-top:10px">
    seL4 is an attractive platform for building highly resilient
    systems, but to do so requires a fair degree of understanding of
    the technology. Fortunately, help is available from a growing
    number of community members offering <strong>products</strong> that ease system
    development and assurance, and provide <strong>training</strong>, consulting and development
    <strong>services</strong> around seL4.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Foundation is working with members on developing <strong>certification</strong>
    schemes for services, training and products. Until these are in place, we
    provide <a href="endorsement.pml"><strong>interim endorsements</strong></a>,
    which are based on a fast and relatively shallow
    assessment. Interim endorsements are available to seL4 Foundation
    members only and will lapse once the (thorough) certification schemes are in place. We
    will support members with interim endorsements in achieving full
    certification. Certification will be open to anyone.
  </p>
  <p>
    The certification (for now endorsement) will indicate:
  </p>
    <ul>
      <li> that a particular <strong>service provider</strong> has the skills and experience
           to provide high-quality services to adopters of seL4;
      </li>
      <li> that a particular <strong>training</strong> is of high quality and effective
           in providing useful skills for deploying the seL4 microkernel;
      </li>
      <li> that a particular <strong>product</strong> is helpful to the community
           for building high-assurance seL4-based systems.
    </ul>
