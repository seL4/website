    seL4 is an attractive platform for building highly resilient
    systems, but to do so requires a fair degree of understanding of
    the technology. Fortunately, help is available from a growing
    number of community members offering <strong>products</strong> that ease system
    development and assurance, and provide <strong>training</strong>, consulting and development
    <strong>services</strong> around seL4.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Foundation is working with members on developing <strong>certification</strong>
    schemes for services, training and products. Until these are in place, we
    provide <a href="endorsement.pml"><strong>interim endorsements</strong></a>,
    which are based on a fast and relatively shallow
    assessment. Interim endorsements are available to seL4 Foundation
    members only and will lapse once the (thorough) certification schemes are in place. We
    will support members with interim endorsements in achieving full
    certification. Certification will be open to anyone.
  </p>
  <p>
    The certification (for now endorsement) will indicate:
  </p>
    <ul>
      <li> that a particular <strong>service provider</strong> has the skills and experience
           to provide high-quality services to adopters of seL4;
      </li>
      <li> that a particular <strong>training</strong> is of high quality and effective
           in providing useful skills for deploying the seL4 microkernel;
      </li>
      <li> that a particular <strong>product</strong> is helpful to the community
           for building high-assurance seL4-based systems.
    </ul>

	<strong>Advanced Operating Systems at UNSW</strong><br/>
	COMP9424 &ldquo;Advanced Operating Systems&rdquo; (AOS) is a
	highly advanced course at UNSW Sydney, taught since
	1997. Since 2011 the course has been based on seL4, and as of
	2020, recordings of all seL4-related lectures
	are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbSaCpDlfd6qLbEsKquVo3--0gwYBmrUV">available
	on YouTube</a>.

	    The lecture slides, and links to lecture recordings on
	    YouTube are available

	  <li>
	    But note that this is a full-trimester course where students
	    learn about microkernels in general, and seL4 in particular, in
	    great detail. This means that the lecture material goes to much
	    greater depth than is appropriate for a day- or week-long
	    training session. Keep this in mind when trying to base your own
	    training on AOS!
