  <p style="padding-top:10px">
    seL4 is an attractive platform for building highly resilient
    systems, but to do so requires a fair degree of understanding of
    the technology. Fortunately, help is available from a growing
    number of community members offering <strong>products</strong> that ease system
    development and assurance, and provide <strong>training</strong>, consulting and development
    <strong>services</strong> around seL4.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Foundation is working with members on developing <strong>certification</strong>
    schemes for services, training and products. Until these are in place, we
    provide <a href="endorsement.pml"><strong>provisional endorsements</strong></a>,
    which will lapse once the certification schemes are in place. We
    will support members with provisional endorsements in achieving full
    certification.
  </p>
  <p>
    The certification (or endorsement for now) will indicate:
    <ul>
      <li> that a particular <strong>service provider</strong> has the skills and experience
           to provide high-quality services to adopters of seL4;
      </li>
      <li> that a particular <strong>training</strong> is of high quality and effective
           in providing useful skills for deploying the seL4 microkernel;
      </li>
      <li> that a particular <strong>product</strong> is helpful to the community
           for building high-assurance seL4-based systems.
    </ul>
  </p>
