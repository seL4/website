    seL4 is an attractive platform for building highly resilient
    systems, but to do so requires a fair degree of understanding of
    the technology. Fortunately, help is available from a growing
    number of community members offering <strong>products</strong> that ease system
    development and assurance, and provide <strong>training</strong>, consulting and development
    <strong>services</strong> around seL4.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Foundation is working with members on establishing <strong>endorsement</strong>
    schemes for services, training and products. As a first step we
    started to
    provide <a href="endorsement.pml"><strong>interim endorsements</strong></a>,
    which are based on a fast and relatively shallow
    assessment. Interim endorsements are available to seL4 Foundation
    members only and will lapse once the full endorsement scheme is in
    place, but we expect that all interim-endorsed services and
    products will achieve full endorsement, and will support the
    members to get there. The endorsement scheme will
    be open to anyone for a fee.
  </p>
  <p>
    The endorsement indicates:
  </p>
    <ul>
      <li> that a particular <strong>service provider</strong> has the skills and experience
           to provide high-quality services to adopters of seL4;
      </li>
      <li> that a particular <strong>training program</strong> is of high quality and effective
           in providing useful skills for deploying the seL4 microkernel;
      </li>
      <li> that a particular <strong>product</strong> utilises seL4
	capabilities correctly and is helpful to the community
        for building high-assurance seL4-based systems.
    </ul>

        The Trustworthy Systems (TS) team is the creator of seL4 and

        of support. With the seL4 Foundation now in place, and at its
        new home at UNSW, TS can now focus on seL4-related research
        and driving development, leaving engineering mostly to other
        ecosystem players. However, TS happy to take on research and
        consultancy contracts, as well as providing engineering
        (systems and verification) services when no commercial player
        is available.

        Formal verification is what makes seL4 unique. With increasing uptake
        and adoption, seL4 is evolving, supporting more platforms,
        architectures, configurations, and features. An increasing number of
        high assurance systems are built with seL4 as a trustworthy foundation.

	As seL4 code evolves, so must its formal proofs. As more systems are
	built on seL4, there is an increased need to ensure correct
	configuration and initialisation, and correctness of critical
	components.

        Proofcraft is here to help. Founded by the seL4 verification leaders, it
        offers commercial support, verification projects, training and
        consulting on formal verification in general, and involving seL4
        specifically.

	By applying mathematical machine-checked software verification,
	Proofcraft increases critical software systems' reliability, safety and
	security, for a verified future.

	<strong>TRENTOS</strong><br/>

        With the Trusted Entity Operating System (TRENTOS), HENSOLDT
        Cyber provides secure IT from the bottom up, by building upon
        the mathematically proved seL4 microkernel and its software ecosystem and
        trusted open-source components.  With the
        TRENTOS SDK, HENSOLDT Cyber provides a complete development environment
        that equips a developer with all the tools required for building,
        testing and deploying TRENTOS-based systems to the real world.
        The SDK contains the actual operating system (OS) source code,
        consisting of seL4, CAmkES and TRENTOS, but also offers a collection of
        additional resources designed to make developer’s work easier by
        increasing efficiency and reducing complexity.
