  Professional Services <br> and Products for seL4-based Systems <br>
</h1>
<div>
  <p>
    seL4 is an attractive platform for building highly resilient
    systems, but to do so requires a fair degree of understanding of
    the technology. Fortunately, help is available from a growing
    number of Foundation members offering products that ease system
    development and assurance, and provide consulting and development
    services around seL4.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Foundation is working with members on developing certification
    programs for products and services. Until these are in place, we
    will provide provisional endorsements of products and services,
    which will lapse once the certification schemes are in place. We
    will members with provisional endorsements in achieving full
    certification.
