  <p style="padding-top:10px">
    seL4 is an attractive platform for building highly resilient
    systems, but to do so requires a fair degree of understanding of
    the technology. Fortunately, help is available from a growing
    number of community members offering <strong>products</strong> that ease system
    development and assurance, and provide <strong>training</strong>, consulting and development
    <strong>services</strong> around seL4.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Foundation is working with members on establishing <strong>endorsement</strong>
    schemes for services, training and products. As a first step we
    started to
    provide <a href="endorsement.pml"><strong>interim endorsements</strong></a>,
    which are based on a fast and relatively shallow
    assessment. Interim endorsements are available to seL4 Foundation
    members only and will lapse once the full endorsement scheme is in
    place, but we expect that all interim-endorsed services and
    products will achieve full endorsement, and will support the
    members to get there. The endorsement scheme will
    be open to anyone for a fee.
  </p>
  <p>
    The endorsement indicates:
  </p>
    <ul>
      <li> that a particular <strong>service provider</strong> has the skills and experience
           to provide high-quality services to adopters of seL4;
      </li>
      <li> that a particular <strong>training program</strong> is of high quality and effective
           in providing useful skills for deploying the seL4 microkernel;
      </li>
      <li> that a particular <strong>product</strong> utilises seL4
	capabilities correctly and is helpful to the community
        for building high-assurance seL4-based systems.
    </ul>

	<strong>Advanced Operating Systems at UNSW</strong><br/>
	COMP9242 &ldquo;Advanced Operating Systems&rdquo; (AOS) is a
	highly advanced course at UNSW Sydney, taught since
	1997. Since 2011 the course has been based on seL4, and as of
	2020, recordings of all seL4-related lectures
	are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbSaCpDlfd6qLbEsKquVo3--0gwYBmrUV">available

	<p>
	  Note that this is a full-trimester course where students
	  learn about microkernels in general, and seL4 in particular, in
	  great detail. This means that the lecture material goes to much
	  greater depth than is appropriate for a day- or week-long
	  training session. Keep this in mind when trying to base your own
	  training on AOS!
