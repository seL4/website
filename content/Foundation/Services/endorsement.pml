    The Foundation is working on developing <strong>certification</strong>
    schemes for services, training and products.
    Until these are in place, we provide <strong>provisional endorsements</strong>.

	      known and respected in the seL4 Community;
	    </li>

	      seL4-based systems;
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      has a track record of contributions to the seL4 ecosystem.
