  Process and guidelines to get an interim endorsement from the Foundation
</h1>
<div>
  <p>
    As explained <a href="home">here</a>,
    the Foundation is working with members on developing <strong>certification</strong>
    programs for services, training and products. Until these are in place, we
    will provide <strong>provisional endorsements</strong>,
    which will lapse once the certification schemes are in place. We
    will support members with provisional endorsements in achieving full
    certification.
  </p>


  <h2>Services</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>
  The certification (or endorsement for now) will indicate
  that a particular <strong>provider</strong> has the skills and experience
  to provide high-quality services to adopters of seL4.
  </li>
  <li>
  <strong>Guidelines</strong>:
    <ul>
    <li>
    The seL4 Compliance Committee (CC) will award Interim Endorsement
    of an seL4 Service Provider based on an assessment that the provider is: 
      <ul>
      <li>
      known and respected in the seL4 Community;
      </li>	  
      <li>
      has demonstrated technical competence in the development of code
      or proofs of the seL4 kernel or software components running
      directly the seL4 kernel or tools supporting the development of
      seL4-based systems;
      </li>
      <li>
      has a track record of contributions to the seL4 ecosystem.
      </li>	  
      </ul>	 
    The CC may seek opinions from representatives of the
    Foundation’s Technical Steering Committee (TSC).
    </li>
    <li>
    A developer/provider of a Training Module may request Interim
    Endorsement by contacting the CC via email, giving at least three
    weeks warning prior to providing the actual material.
    </li>
    <li>   
    The CC will provides its assessment within two weeks of receiving
    the material. The assessment may either be an unconditional
    endorsement, or an conditional endorsement pending some required
    changes, or a list of recommended changes for a new revised
    submission. The assessment may be based on presentation 1 material
    alone but may also include an examination of any code provided for
    hands-on training, at the discretion of the CC.
    </li>
    <li>   
    All endorsed training modules will be advertised <a
    href="here">here</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
    Interim Endorsement will be provided for free and to members only.
    </li>
    </ul> 
  </ul>

  <h2>Training</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>
  The certification (or endorsement for now) will indicate
  that a particular <strong>training</strong> is of high quality and effective
  in providing useful skills for deploying the seL4 microkernel.
  </li>
  <li>
  <strong>Guidelines</strong>:
    <ul>
    <li>
    The seL4 Compliance Committee (CC) will award Interim Endorsement
    of an seL4 Training Module based on an assessment of the training
    material (presentation material and potentially code used in
    hands-on training sessions), to ensure that:
      <ul>
      <li>
      it is technically correct and of sufficient depth and breadth
      </li>
      <li>
      it is compliant with the Foundation’s Trademark Guidelines.
      </li>
      </ul>

  <li><strong>Guidelines</strong>:
    <ul>
    <li>
    There are different categories of products that could possibly be
    certified but will require different treatment:
      <ul>
      <li>
      components for seL4-based systems (eg. library, device driver, authentication service)
      </li>
      <li>
      developer tools (eg. compiler, static analysis tool, IDE)
      </li>
      <li>
      seL4-based end-user products
      </li>
