  <p style="padding-top:10px">
    The Foundation is working on developing <strong>endorsement</strong>
    schemes for services, training and products.
    Until these are in place, we provide <strong>interim endorsements</strong>.
    All (interim) endorsed training modules and services are advertised <a href="home.pml">here</a>.
    Interim endorsements are provided for free and to Foundation members only.
    More info  <a href="home.pml">here</a>.

      <strong>Guidelines</strong>:
      <ul>
	<li>
	  The (for now, interim) endorsement indicates
	  that a particular <strong>service provider has the skills and experience
	    to provide high-quality services to adopters of seL4 </strong>.
	</li>
	<li>
	  The interim endorsement of an seL4 service provider is awarded based on an assessment that the provider is:
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      known and respected in the seL4 Community;
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      has demonstrated technical competence in the development of code
	      or proofs of the seL4 kernel or software components running
	      directly the seL4 kernel or tools supporting the development of
	      seL4-based systems;
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      has a track record of contributions to the seL4 ecosystem.
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
      </ul>
  </ul>

  <h2>Training</h2>

          <a title="foundation@sel4.systems"
             href= "mailto:foundation@sel4.systems">
	    foundation@sel4.systems</a>
	  <strong>at least 3 weeks before sending the actual
	    training material</strong>;
	</li>
	<li>
	  Within two weeks of sending the material, you will receive the Foundation's assessment, which may be:
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      either an unconditional interim endorsement,
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      or a conditional interim endorsement subject to some required changes,
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      or a list of recommended changes for a revised submission.
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	  The assessment may be based on presentation material
	  alone but may also include an examination of any code provided for
	  hands-on training, at the discretion of the Foundation.
	</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Guidelines</strong>:
      <ul>
	<li>
	  The (for now, interim) endorsement indicates
	  that a particular <strong>training is of high quality and effective
	    in providing useful skills for deploying the seL4 microkernel</strong>.
	</li>
	<li>
	  The interim endorsement of an seL4 training module will be
	  awarded based on an assessment of the training material
	  (presentation material and potentially code used in hands-on
	  training sessions), to ensure that:
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      it is technically correct and of sufficient depth and breadth
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      it is compliant with the Foundation's Trademark Guidelines.
	    </li>
	  </ul>
