      In the development of high assurance systems with military grade
      security, HENSOLDT Cyber works intensively with the seL4
      microkernel. As we aim to increase the usability of seL4
      technologies, we develop user-friendly components bundled in the
      seL4 operating system TRENTOS, providing an easy-to-use basis
      for the development of embedded systems.  We support our
      customers by guiding them with our seL4 experience and improving
      their development time by advising them on the correct
      application of the seL4 technologies.<br>

	<span class=emph>HENSOLDT Cyber GmbH has received <em>interim endorsement</em> as a Trusted
	Service Provider for seL4-based systems and for our training
	offering for seL4. Our TRENTOS operating system has received
	interim endorsement as a seL4 product as well.</span>
