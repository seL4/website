  9 Jun 2020: functional correctness proof of seL4 RISC-V
</div>
<div>
 <p>

RISC-V (RV64) is the third ISA with verified seL4. The functional
correctness proof of seL4 on the RV64 ISA has
completed. Congratulations to the awesome Proof Engineering Team of
the Trustworthy Systems group on achieving this major milestone for
seL4! And many thanks to HENSOLDT Cyber for making it possible.

What we have now is the refinement proof from the seL4 formal spec to the C
implementation, putting RV64 on the same level as x64 in terms of seL4 verification. The
binary verification, which extends this refinement to the binary code of the kernel is
progressing, stay tuned for more news on that in the foreseeable future.

More on this in this <a
href="https://microkerneldude.wordpress.com/2020/06/09/sel4-is-verified-on-risc-v/">blog
post</a>.

  2 Jun 2020: UNSW seL4 teaching videos available
</div>
<div>
 <p>

  Yet another contribution of UNSW Sydney to the seL4 community: This
  year Gernot Heiser is making the seL4-related videos from his UNSW
  Advanced Operating Systems class freely available. You’ll find them
  at the <a
  href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbSaCpDlfd6qLbEsKquVo3--0gwYBmrUV">UNSW
  CSeLearning COMP9242 YouTube channel</a>.

  At present there are the first two modules, which provide some
  background on microkernels and seL4, and discuss the seL4 API. More
  material will show up over the next two months.

  The complete course material, including all lecture slides, the
  project spec and code, are available, as always, from the <a
  href="https://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9242/current/">COMP9042 web
  site</a>.

  25 May 2020: seL4 Foundation whitepaper released
</div>

   <img src="About/whitepaper.svg"
   style="width:15%; padding-left:1em; padding-bottom:1em; float:right"
   alt="seL4 Whitepaper">
   </a>


   The whitepaper "The seL4 Microkernel – An Introduction" provides an
   introduction to and overview of seL4. We explain what seL4 is (and
   is not) and explore its defining features. We explain what makes
   seL4 uniquely qualified as the operating-system kernel of choice
   for security- and safety- critical systems, and generally embedded
   and cyber-physical systems. In particular, we explain seL4’s
   assurance story, its security- and safety-relevant features, and
   its benchmark-setting performance. We also discuss typical usage
   scenarios, including incremental cyber retrofit of legacy systems.

   You can download <a href="https://sel4.systems/About/">here</a>.

   The <a href="https://ts.data61.csiro.au">Trustworthy Systems
   group</a> is excited to announce the creation of the <a
   href="/Foundation/">seL4 Foundation</a>. Its aim is to provide a
   neutral and independent organisation to ensure the longevity of
   seL4, and grow its ecosystem of adopters and contributors.

   It has a <a href="/Foundation/Board/">high-profile Board</a>
   consisting of Gernot Heiser (Chair), June Andronick, Gerwin Klein,
   John Launchbury, Sascha Kegreiß, Daniel Potts.

   It already has a number of members, including major adopters
   HENSOLDT Cyber and Ghost Systems, and providers of services for
   seL4, Cog Systems and DornerWorks. Please check the <a
   href="/Foundation/Membership/">membership page</a> for details and
   how to join.

   The seL4 Foundation is set up under the Linux Foundation, which
   provides a mature and well-known framework.
