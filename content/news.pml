  5 May 2021: RISC-V International and seL4 Foundation Announce New Security Milestone
</div>
<div>
 <p>
   <img src="/Foundation/Membership/LOGOS/RISC-V.svg"
   style="width: 15%;  padding-left:10px;  float:right"
	alt="RISC-V logo">

   Today, the <a href="/Foundation/">seL4 Foundation</a> and
   <a href="https://riscv.org">RISC-V International</a> announced that the
   verified seL4 microkernel on the RV64 architecture has been proved
   down to the executable code
   by <a href="https://data61.csiro.au">CSIRO’s Data61</a>, thanks to
   funding provided by <a href="https://hensoldt-cyber.com">HENSOLDT
   Cyber GmbH</a>. This guarantees that the seL4 microkernel on RV64
   will operate to specification even when built with an untrusted C
   compiler, GCC.
 </p>

 <p>
   Within and across open collaboration communities it is essential to
   work together on areas of mutual interest. RISC-V and seL4 are
   pleased to announce their progress and their alliances as they join
   forces to enable stronger overall security, combining
   security-oriented architecture and operating system design.
 </p>

 <p>
   &ldquo;We are excited to be one of the first architectures with
   secure operating system kernels with such a strong formal
   verification story,&rdquo; said Mark Himelstein, CTO of RISC-V
   International. &ldquo;RISC-V is continuing to increase the security
   features that encompass the ISA and the secure seL4 kernel is a
   natural complement.&rdquo;
 </p>

 <p>
   &ldquo;This is another milestone for seL4, which continues to
   define the state of the art in OS security,&rdquo; added Prof
   Gernot Heiser, Chairman of the seL4 Foundation. &ldquo;Stronger
   aligning the two open ecosystems makes a lot of sense.&rdquo;
 </p>

 <p>
   &ldquo;The verified seL4 microkernel forms the core of TRENTOS, our
   secure operating system for our MiG-V chip, a RISC-V processor with
   supply chain security&rdquo;, said Sascha Kegrei&szlig;&rdquo;, CTO
   of HENSOLDT Cyber GmbH. &ldquo;This unique combination of hardware
   and software security can protect critical assets from advanced
   persistent cyber threats.&rdquo;
 </p>

 <p>
   &rdquo;Translation validation ties all of our verification efforts
   together,&rdquo; said Dr Zoltan Kocsis, CSIRO Verification
   Engineer. &ldquo;Bringing translation validation to a modern,
   64-bit processor presented significant scalability challenges but,
   in the end, we were able to overcome them.&rdquo;
 </p>

 <p>

   The seL4 Foundation

 </p>
 <p>
   Members of the Raytheon Technologies team have been long-time core
   participants in the seL4 ecosystem, predating the company’s
   formation in 2020, which brought together Raytheon Company and
   United Technologies’ aerospace businesses, Collins Aerospace and
   Pratt &amp; Whitney. Collins Aerospace was a prime contractor in the
   DARPA HACMS program, which demonstrated the seL4-based incremental
   cyber retrofit of autonomous military vehicles. This was a major
   milestone in the growth of seL4, demonstrating that it protects
   against cyber attacks on real systems in operation. The same
   Raytheon Technologies team now leads the follow-on DARPA CASE
   program, aiming at designed-in cyber-resiliency, including the
   seL4-based framework for verified initialisation and configuration
   of systems architectures.

  9 Jun 2020: functional correctness proof of seL4 RISC-V
</div>
<div>
 <p>

RISC-V (RV64) is the third ISA with verified seL4. The functional
correctness proof of seL4 on the RV64 ISA has
completed. Congratulations to the awesome Proof Engineering Team of
the Trustworthy Systems group on achieving this major milestone for
seL4! And many thanks to HENSOLDT Cyber for making it possible.

What we have now is the refinement proof from the seL4 formal spec to the C
implementation, putting RV64 on the same level as x64 in terms of seL4 verification. The
binary verification, which extends this refinement to the binary code of the kernel is
progressing, stay tuned for more news on that in the foreseeable future.

More on this in this <a

  At present there are the first two modules, which provide some
  background on microkernels and seL4, and discuss the seL4 API. More
  material will show up over the next two months.

  The complete course material, including all lecture slides, the
  project spec and code, are available, as always, from the <a

   alt="seL4 Whitepaper">
   </a>


   The whitepaper "The seL4 Microkernel – An Introduction" provides an
   introduction to and overview of seL4. We explain what seL4 is (and
   is not) and explore its defining features. We explain what makes
   seL4 uniquely qualified as the operating-system kernel of choice
   for security- and safety- critical systems, and generally embedded
   and cyber-physical systems. In particular, we explain seL4’s
   assurance story, its security- and safety-relevant features, and
   its benchmark-setting performance. We also discuss typical usage
   scenarios, including incremental cyber retrofit of legacy systems.

   It has a <a href="/Foundation/Board/">high-profile Board</a>
   consisting of Gernot Heiser (Chair), June Andronick, Gerwin Klein,
   John Launchbury, Sascha Kegreiß, Daniel Potts.

   It already has a number of members, including major adopters
   HENSOLDT Cyber and Ghost Systems, and providers of services for
   seL4, Cog Systems and DornerWorks. Please check the <a
