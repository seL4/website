<p>
  Have a look at the <a
  href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/archive/2023/sel4-summit/program/schedule/">program</a>
  of the <a href="../Summit/2023">seL4 Summit 2023</a>! We have a great line-up
  of interesting seL4 work, with a combination of technical research and
  development, experience reports of seL4 in the field, technical discussions
  and birds-of-a-feather sessions, as well as a training session on getting
  started with seL4.
