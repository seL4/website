<p>
  Have a look at the <a href="https://sel4summit2023.sched.com/">program</a> of
  the <a href="../Foundation/Summit/2023">seL4 summit 2023</a>! We have a great
  line-up of interesting seL4 work, with a combination of technical research and
  development, experience reports of seL4 in the field, technical discussions
  and birds-of-a-feather sessions, as well as a training session on getting
  started with seL4.
