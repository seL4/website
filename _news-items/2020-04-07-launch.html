<p>
  The <a href="https://trustworthy.systems">Trustworthy Systems group</a> is
  excited to announce the creation of the <a href="../Foundation/">seL4
  Foundation</a>. Its aim is to provide a neutral and independent organisation
  to ensure the longevity of seL4, and grow its ecosystem of adopters and
  contributors.

  It has a <a href="../Foundation/Board/">high-profile Board</a>
  consisting of Gernot Heiser (Chair), June Andronick, Gerwin Klein, John
  Launchbury, Sascha Kegreiß, Daniel Potts.

  It already has a number of members, including major adopters HENSOLDT Cyber
  and Ghost Systems, and providers of services for seL4, Cog Systems and
  DornerWorks. Please check the <a href="../Foundation/Membership/">membership
  page</a> for details and how to join.

  The seL4 Foundation is set up under the Linux Foundation, which provides a
  mature and well-known framework.
