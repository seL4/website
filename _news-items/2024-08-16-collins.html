  It was a prime contractor in the DARPA HACMS
  program, which demonstrated the seL4-based incremental cyber retrofit of
  autonomous military vehicles. This was a major milestone in the growth of seL4,
  demonstrating that it protects against cyber attacks on real systems in
  operation. The same team also led the follow-on DARPA CASE program, aiming at
  designed-in cyber-resiliency, including the seL4-based framework for verified
  initialisation and configuration of systems architectures.`
