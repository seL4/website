<p>
  The seL4 Foundation thanks <a href="https://www.collinsaerospace.com">Collins Aerospace</a> for
  becoming a Bronze sponsor of the <a href="../Foundation/Summit/2024">seL4
  Summit 2024</a>.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.collinsaerospace.com">Collins Aerospace</a>, part of seL4 Foundation
    member <a href="https://www.rtx.com">Raytheon Technologies</a>, has been a long-time core
    participant in the seL4 ecosystem.
  It was a prime contractor in the DARPA HACMS
  program, which demonstrated the seL4-based incremental cyber retrofit of
  autonomous military vehicles. This was a major milestone in the growth of seL4,
  demonstrating that it protects against cyber attacks on real systems in
  operation. The same team also led the follow-on DARPA CASE program, aiming at
  designed-in cyber-resiliency, including the seL4-based framework for verified
  initialisation and configuration of systems architectures.
</p>
<p>
  Collins Aerospace is now leading the INSPECTA team as part of DARPA's PROVERS program, which aims at developing formal methods tools to guide software engineers through designing proof-friendly software systems and reduce the proof repair workload.
