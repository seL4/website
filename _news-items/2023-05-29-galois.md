We are pleased to have [Galois](https://galois.com/) now part of the seL4
Foundation, following its acquisition of Adventium labs, which has been a
[member](../Foundation/Membership/) since 2020 and user of seL4 technologies for
years before that. Galois develops technology to guarantee the trustworthiness
of systems where failure is unacceptable. They apply cutting edge computer
science and mathematics to advance the state of the art in software and hardware
trustworthiness. The seL4 Foundation looks forward to our continuing
collaboration.
