  The seL4 Foundation thanks Ghost for its
  generous contribution. Ghost's commitment strengthens the seL4
  Foundation's mission to continue advancing the ecosystem, the code
  base, and the verification efforts of seL4, the world's most
  advanced and highly assured operating-system kernel.
</p>

<p>
  As a founding member of the Foundation, Ghost is developing
  self-driving cars using seL4, aiming to make the first formally
  proven safety-critical system on the road into a reality for
  millions of drivers.

<p>
  We warmly thank Ghost for its continued support!
