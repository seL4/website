There is now a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@seL4) run by the seL4
Foundation. It presently has two playlists, one with the recordings of the seL4
material from this yearâ€™s UNSW Advanced Operating Systems course, and one with
seL4 Summit talks from Trustworthy Systems.

More to come, enjoy.
