<p>
  We are excited to announce the launch of the new <a
  href="https://docs.sel4.systems/">seL4 docsite</a>! The redesigned site
  provides a new structure and layout, is simple and uncluttered with easier
  access to information, and is centered around the current main seL4-related
  technologies.
</p>

<p>
We will continue to make incremental updates to the docsite, as we work on
releasing the latest documentation about the seL4 technology and associated
frameworks, languages, components and systems.
</p>

<p>
  We thank <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/">NCSC</a> for their funding of this
  project and also the development of the new <a href="{{ '/' | relative_url
  }}">seL4 website</a>.
</p>

<p>
  We welcome your feedback and we hope you enjoy the new site!
</p>
