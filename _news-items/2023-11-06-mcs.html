title: Progress on MCS verification thanks to XCalibyte donation
anchor: mcs-xcalibyte
---

<p>
  Foundation member <a href="https://proofcraft.systems">Proofcraft</a> has
  delivered a <a href="https://proofcraft.systems/news-2023/#2023-11-06">work
    package towards the verification of the MCS variant of seL4</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Having earlier started the design-to-code refinement proof of MCS seL4, funded
  by the Foundation, Proofcraft has now delivered the completion of the proof
  framework, setting up all the infrastructure and hierarchy of theorems about
  the approximately 500 C functions of the kernel.
</p>

<p>
  This was made possible by a generous donation from Foundation member <a
  href="https://xcalibyte.com">XCalibyte</a>, for which the seL4 Foundation is
  very grateful. We are looking for <a
  href="https://sel4.systems/Foundation/Support/">further funding</a> that will
  allow completion of the verification of the MCS variant. Once verified, MCS
  will become the default configuration of seL4, bringing the highest levels of
  assurance to mixed-criticality real-time systems.
