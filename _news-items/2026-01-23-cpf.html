    NEW!
  </p>
  <p>
    The 2026 edition of the seL4 summit will feature a <strong><span
    class="text-f_green-600">full first day</span></strong> dedicated to
    <strong><span class="text-f_green-600">applications, overviews, and
    perspectives</span></strong> on seL4-based systems and  formally verified
    software in the real world. This will be followed by Days 2 and 3 focusing
    on more technical development, research, reports, and discussions.
  </p>
  <p>
    We are particularly keen to <strong><span class="text-f_green-600">welcome

    landscape and ecosystem</span></strong> of seL4 and its associated tools,
    frameworks and languages, as well as formally verified software in general,
    and to take stock of the latest updates.
