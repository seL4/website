We are extremely pleased to announce that the functional correctness proof for
seL4 on the 64-bit Arm architecture (AArch64) is complete!

We congratulate to our member [Proofcraft](https://proofcraft.systems/) for this
great achievement, which marks a major milestone in the development of the seL4
microkernel and its ecosystem.

We also would like to express our immense gratitude to UK's [National Cyber
Security Centre](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/) (NCSC) for funding this work, which
is of great importance for the seL4 ecosystem.
