    The seL4 Foundation is pleased to welcome Germany’s <a href="https://www.cyberagentur.de/en/">Cyberagentur</a> as <a href="../Foundation/Membership">Associate Member</a>, coinciding with the <a href="https://www.cyberagentur.de/presse/ein-meilenstein-fuer-it-sicherheit-in-deutschland/">launch</a> of five projects in its research program on an “Ecosystem of formally verified IT – provable cybersecurity (EvIT)”. Two of the projects include work enhancing seL4. The Cyberagentur is joining the seL4 Foundation to underline the importance of this approach for making both highly complex IT systems and critical infrastructures more secure and to attract further supporters. The Cyberagentur funds cybersecurity research projects with a high risk and a very high potential of disruption.
