For the last year, Nick Spinale, funded by the seL4 Foundation, has been
developing support for the Rust programming language in seL4 userspace.

Nick has created a comprehensive language support infrastructure that integrates
well with the rest of the seL4 ecosystem (capDL, Microkit, sel4test) and also
integrates well with what Rust programmers would expect from the language side.
This work has now been accepted by the seL4 Foundation
[Technical Steering Committee](../Foundation/TSC) and can be found on
[GitHub](https://github.com/seL4/rust-sel4). Nick’s talk at the recent seL4
summit is on [seL4’s Youtube channel](https://youtu.be/J17lC124_9s?si=e8nDp-x8OLq6h1dO).
A demo system that uses the device driver framework, asynchronous programming in
Rust and library support from the Rust ecosystem to implement a small web server
is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/seL4/rust-microkit-http-server-demo).

The overall outcome will be to allow people to write safer user-level code on
top of seL4 without needing full formal verification, with a language that is
receiving increasing interest and that aligns extremely well with security and
safety critical embedded systems programming.
