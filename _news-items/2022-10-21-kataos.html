<p>
  The seL4 Foundation welcomes the <a
  href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2022/10/announcing-kataos-and-sparrow.html">open-sourcing
  of core components of KataOS</a> created by our Member <a
  href="https://google.com">Google</a>. KataOS is based on seL4 and implemented
  mostly in the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org">Rust programming
  language</a>. KataOS is to be combined with a secure hardware platform on the
  RISC-V architecture.
</p>
<p>
  This is an exciting addition to the seL4 ecosystem that will ease deployment
  of seL4-based systems. It also adds improved support for <a
  href="https://antmicro.com/blog/2022/08/running-rust-programs-in-sel4/">running
  Rust programs on seL4</a>, which is a hot topic in the seL4 community.
