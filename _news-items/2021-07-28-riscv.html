  The assurance story for <a href="https://sel4.systems">seL4</a>
  on <a href="https://riscv.org">RISC-V</a> keeps building. We first formally
  proved <em>functional correctness</em>: <a
  href="https://microkerneldude.wordpress.com/2020/06/09/sel4-is-verified-on-risc-v/">that
  the seL4 C code on RISC-V platforms behaves exactly as its specification
  says</a>. We then established <em>binary correctness</em>: <a
  href="https://microkerneldude.wordpress.com/2021/05/05/sel4-on-risc-v-verified-to-binary-code/">that
  the machine code running on the processor behaves exactly as the C code, and
  by extension, as the specification says</a>. We now have established the
  crucial <strong>integrity</strong> property for seL4 on RISC-V: that the
  specification, and by extension the kernel binary, prevents an application
  running on top from modifying data without authorisation. In seL4 speak: seL4
  provably enforces capability-based access control.

<p>
  &ldquo;The integrity property is crucial for security: it is key to enforce
  the <strong>isolation</strong> of components running on top of the
  kernel&rdquo;, says Gerwin Klein, seL4 verification expert and chair of the
  seL4 Foundation technical steering committee. &ldquo;This is what allows
  critical components, like the network controller that has access to
  software-controlled brakes in a modern car, to securely run alongside
  untrusted software, like the entertainment system. With integrity proved, you
  know that an attack on or from a vulnerable untrusted part of the system
  cannot compromise the critical parts.&rdquo;

  Integrity had been proved in the original seL4 verification on the
  Arm32 architecture. It is now also established for RISC-V
  architecture, making it the only 64-bit architecture that has an OS
  with such a comprehensive verification and security story. We thank
