<p>
  It has been heart-warming to see the response of the seL4 community to the
  news of the dismantlement of the Trustworthy Systems group (TS), creator of
  seL4.
</p>

<p>
  The seL4 Foundation, as well as its members and ecosystem, want to reinforce
  their commitment to the success and support of seL4. The TS team will be
  rebuilding at UNSW and a number of Foundation-endorsed <a
  href="../Services">seL4 services providers</a> as well as the newly
  created <a href="https://proofcraft.systems">Proofcraft</a> verification
  company are dedicated to support seL4 in the future.
</p>
<p>

  With this recent news, it's never been more important to work together as a
  community to support seL4 and the transition of the support and development to
  the Foundation and its members. People have been asking how to help. Offers of
  support keep coming. We are looking at various options for sustainable
  support, with a priority of keeping the team together. There are options on
  the table that we are exploring that may allow us to do that. Please help us
  with that, the existing TS team is the best base for stable seL4 support.
</p>
<p>
  <b> In the meantime, here are 4 concrete things that can be done now. Spread
  the word to people who care about seL4’s future, and
    <a href="mailto:foundation@sel4.systems">contact us</a> if you
    want to discuss.</b>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>

    <b> donations and crowdfunding, in particular towards the &ldquo;continuity
    project&rdquo;.</b><br>

    The crowd-funding platform works for large and small financial
    contributions, and contributions can be dedicated to specific topics. Fans
    are always welcome to contribute and show the continued support to seL4 :),
    but if you know of companies that would like to show financial support
    without a longer-term commitment, this is a quick and easy mechanism to do
    so.<br>
    We have set up a dedicated “continuity project” to raise funds specifically
    targeted to the transition of the infrastructure (testing, boards etc) and
    the immediate support needs (maintenance of all configurations, libraries,
    releases etc) to the Foundation. All donors of $1,000 and above will be
    listed on the page above.

  </li>
  <li>

    <b> get more members signed up to the Foundation.</b><br>

    <a href="../Foundation/Join">https://sel4.systems/Foundation/Join/</a><br>

    A push to get more organisations joining in the coming weeks will be a clear
    message of the strong support to seL4 and will provide the necessary funds
    funds to transition more support to the Foundation. Longer term, membership
    helps deliver on the Foundation’s vision to increase usability, exposure,
    support, education, participation, and verification of seL4. Join or help
    spreading the word to join to your partners and customers.

  </li>
  <li>
    <b>in-kind offer of expertise.</b><br>

    The number of seL4 experts is growing. Active participation and especially
    support for new users and beginners on Discourse
    (https://sel4.discourse.group) and the mailing list will help keep the
    community active. Likewise contributions to reviews and discussion on GitHub
    on pull requests and issues will help to keep things moving. The focus has
    shifted away from just D61 contributions in the past year already, now is
    the time to keep the momentum up. The TS team and people in the technical
    steering committee are working on moving testing and verification
    infrastructure to UNSW. This will include opening up the infrastructure such
    that members can contribute hardware tests. We will send more information
    about this in the next few weeks. Please contact Gerwin as the TSC chair if
    you are interested in this or have additional ideas how to help.<br>

    We were gearing up for the next seL4 release. This might be slightly delayed
    by the infrastructure move, but if everything comes together as planned the
    release will go ahead.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>jobs in the seL4 ecosystem.</b><br>

    While some expertise is needed to be kept within the Foundation, it is also
    important to keep it within the community. We have just set up a page for
    members to post jobs related to seL4. This will help match seL4 experts to
    organisations willing to build upon, develop or support seL4. Contact
    foundation@sel4.systems to post on that page.
