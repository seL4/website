The seL4 Foundation welcomes New-Zealand based [Kry10](https://www.kry10.com/)
as our latest member.

&ldquo;We believe that formal methods and proven code is the only viable option
for software, whether it is AI, Industrial controls, or really anything else.
seL4 is the first, and only real practical kernel to show the world how it
should be done,&rdquo; says Boyd Multerer, CEO and Founder of Kry10.

&ldquo;At Kry10, we are building a full-featured operating system on top of the
seL4 Kernel, along with tooling, services, key management and more. We are
aiming at industrial use, but it is suitable for consumer devices and more.
Combined with the Erlang BEAM VM for applications, we intend to deliver systems
with great security and minimal downtime, even across upgrades.&rdquo;
