<p>
  The <a href="https://docs.sel4.systems/projects/microkit/">seL4 Microkit</a>,
  formerly known as the Core Platform, is an operating system framework on top
  of seL4 provides a small set of simple abstractions that ease the design and
  implementation of statically structured systems on seL4, while still
  leveraging the kernel’s benefits of security and performance. The Microkit is
  distributed as an SDK that integrates with the developer’s build system of
  choice, significantly reducing the barrier to entry for new users of seL4.
</p>
<p>
  The seL4 Microkit was developed in collaboration between <a
  href="https://brkawy.com/">Breakaway Consulting Pty Ltd</a> and <a
  href="https://trustworthy.systems/">Trustworthy Systems, UNSW</a>, and is now
  an official <a href="../Foundation"> seL4 Foundation</a> project, making it
  part of the seL4 eco-system.
