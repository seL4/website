The seL4 Foundation thanks [Collins Aerospace](https://www.collinsaerospace.com)
for becoming a Silver sponsor of the [seL4 Summit 2023](../Summit/2023).

[Collins Aerospace](https://www.collinsaerospace.com), part of seL4 Foundation
member [Raytheon Technologies](https://www.rtx.com), has been a long-time core
participant in the seL4 ecosystem. It was a prime contractor in the DARPA HACMS
program, which demonstrated the seL4-based incremental cyber retrofit of
autonomous military vehicles. This was a major milestone in the growth of seL4,
demonstrating that it protects against cyber attacks on real systems in
operation. The same team also led the follow-on DARPA CASE program, aiming at
designed-in cyber-resiliency, including the seL4-based framework for verified
initialisation and configuration of systems architectures.

The [seL4 Summit 2023](../Summit/2023) will take place in
Minneapolis, home town of this Collins Aerospace team involved in seL4.

interested in sponsoring the seL4 Summit 2023.
