<p>
  The seL4 Foundation has awarded <strong>interim endorsement</strong> to the
  seL4-based TRENTOS
  secure operating system from Foundation member HENSOLDT Cyber. This is the
  first time a product is endorsed, and marks a new milestone for the Foundation
  and the growth of the seL4 ecosystem.
</p>

<p>
  HENSOLDT Cyber's training module for TRENTOS has also received interim
  endorsement, which constitutes another milestone as the first endorsed
  training provided from outside the Trustworthy Systems group.
