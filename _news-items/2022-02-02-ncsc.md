The seL4 Foundation is pleased to welcome the UK’s
[National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk).

The NCSC, the UK’s technical authority on cyber security, uses the seL4
Microkernel to enforce separation in a number of high-assurance situations. The
government organisation is actively exploring research opportunities to further
develop its seL4 use cases. NCSC Technical Director Dr Ian Levy said: "We’re
pleased to join the seL4 Foundation. seL4 is some of the most highly assured
software and its development plays an important role in the next generation of
high-assurance devices. We support the long-term stability of the seL4
microkernel ecosystem and are looking at opportunities to develop our use cases
for it."
