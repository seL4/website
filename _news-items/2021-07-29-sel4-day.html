  On 29th July 2009, the original functional correctness proof of seL4 was
  completed, a widely-recognised research breakthrough and the first big
  milestone in seL4's history. We obviously had a party then, and have since
  celebrated its anniversary, calling it, tongue-in-cheek, “International Proof
  Day”.
</p>
<p>
  On the fifth anniversary we open-sourced seL4, which was another major
  milestone, which we referred to as “seL4 Freedom Day”.
</p>
<p>
  Today marks the 12th anniversary of the proof, and the 7th anniversary of
  open-sourcing, and from now on we'll refer to the date simply as "seL4 Day”.
</p>
<p>
  The seL4 community is now definitely global. Still we would normally have a
  physical party in Sydney, but won't be able to due to the renewed Covid-19
  restrictions &mdash; so we'll all be remote ;-)

  A virtual toast to you all, and a big thank-you to all for your continued
  support!
