<p>
  The seL4 Foundation thanks <a href="https://unsw.edu.au">UNSW Sydney</a> for
  becoming a Bronze sponsor of the <a href="../Foundation/Summit/2024">seL4
  Summit 2024</a>.
</p>
<p>
  seL4 was created by the <a href="https://trustworthy.systems/">Trustworthy
  Systems (TS)</a> team, which is now part of the <a
  href="https://unsw.edu.au">UNSW</a>, a founding member of the seL4 Foundation.
</p>
<p>
  The team has a track record of designing and implementing systems software for
  performance and reliability, and using rigorous formal methods to prove that
  they meet their security and reliability goals. Their aims are to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>shift the software industry away from ad-hoc, unreliable engineering
  practices, and towards more principled and trustworthy methods; and</li>
  <li>make verified software a default choice, especially in safety- and
  security-critical systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The team works with government and commercial partners, as well as the broader
  software engineering community, to drive this change.
</p>
<p>
  The <a href="../Foundation/Summit/2024">seL4 Summit 2024</a> will take place
  in Sydney, the hometown of <a href="https://trustworthy.systems/">Trustworthy
  Systems</a> and <a href="https://unsw.edu.au">UNSW</a>.
