  <p>
    This year marks a very special seL4 day anniversary.
  </p>
  <p>
    20 years ago, the L4.verified project started, with the ambitious aim to formally verify an entire microkernel of
    the L4 family. seL4 was born.
  </p>
  <p>
    15 years ago, on the 29th of July 2009, the original functional correctness proof of seL4 was completed, a
    widely-recognised research breakthrough and the first big milestone in seL4's history.
  </p>
  <p>
    10 years ago, on the 29th of July 2014, seL4 was open-sourced, an instrumental step towards its adoption in a number
    of sectors.
  </p>
  <p>
    To celebrate these key anniversaries, a special panel will gather at the <a href="../Foundation/Summit/2024">seL4
      summit 2024</a> to reflect on the journey over the past 20 years and discuss the future ahead. Stay tuned for more
    info.
