RISC-V (RV64) is the third ISA with verified seL4. The functional correctness
proof of seL4 on the RV64 ISA has completed. Congratulations to the awesome
Proof Engineering Team of the Trustworthy Systems group on achieving this major
milestone for seL4! And many thanks to HENSOLDT Cyber for making it possible.

What we have now is the refinement proof from the seL4 formal spec to the C
implementation, putting RV64 on the same level as x64 in terms of seL4
verification. The binary verification, which extends this refinement to the
binary code of the kernel is progressing, stay tuned for more news on that in
the foreseeable future.
