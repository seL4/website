The seL4 Foundation welcomes [Xcalibyte](https://xcalibyte.com) as a member.

Xcalibyte's mission is to improve the quality of software by creating
easy-to-use tools that help developers build and deploy reliable and secure
code. Founded by world-class software experts with decades of experience in
compiler optimization and software development, Xcalibyte was established in
2018 and has offices in Shenzhen, Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong. Xcalibyte
enhances the speed and accuracy of code auditing, code evaluation, and code
defect detection. We use advanced static code analysis to help reduce costs,
improve productivity, and ensure software developers in China and all over the
world have the proper capabilities to develop better, more reliable software.

&ldquo;As we are actively working with members of the seL4 Foundation, it makes
perfect sense for us to be part of the organisation. Our code analysis tools are
being used by community members and we are aiming to ensure they develop high
quality and secure code.&rdquo;
