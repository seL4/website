<p>
  In July, we announced that the assurance story for <a
  href="https://sel4.systems">seL4</a> on <a href="https://riscv.org">RISC-V</a>
  keeps building, with the completion of the proof that <a
  href="#integrity-on-risc-v">seL4 enforces integrity</a>, following the earlier
  proofs of functional correctness and binary correctness for seL4 on RISC-V.
</p>
<p>
  The next step in the assurance stack is now also completed for RISC-V with
  the proof that seL4 enforces confidentiality, i.e. that seL4 provably
  enforces information flow control, when it is correctly configured to do so.
</p>
<p>
  "This completes the 3 big CIA security properties for seL4 on RISC-V:
  confidentiality, integrity and availability. While integrity ensures there is
  no unauthorised interference with private data, confidentiality ensures there
  is no unauthorised access to private data”, says Gernot Heiser, chair of the
  seL4 Foundation.
