<p>
  Have a look at the <a href="../Foundation/Summit/2022/program">seL4 summit Program</a>!
  We have an amazing line-up of cool seL4 work, with a combination of
  technical research and development, experience reports of seL4 in the field,
  technical discussions and Birds-of-a-feather sessions, as well as a whole
  day of seL4 bootcamp with tutorials and training.
