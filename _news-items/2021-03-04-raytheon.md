The seL4 Foundation welcomes [Raytheon Technologies](https://www.rtx.com/) as
our latest member.

Members of the Raytheon Technologies team have been long-time core participants
in the seL4 ecosystem, predating the company’s formation in 2020, which brought
together Raytheon Company and United Technologies’ aerospace businesses, Collins
Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney. Collins Aerospace was a prime contractor in the
DARPA HACMS program, which demonstrated the seL4-based incremental cyber
retrofit of autonomous military vehicles. This was a major milestone in the
growth of seL4, demonstrating that it protects against cyber attacks on real
systems in operation. The same Raytheon Technologies team now leads the
follow-on DARPA CASE program, aiming at designed-in cyber-resiliency, including
the seL4-based framework for verified initialisation and configuration of
systems architectures.
