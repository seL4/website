  On 6 August <a href="https://www.darpa.mil">DARPA</a> brought the
  &ldquo;SMACCMcopter&rdquo;
  to <a href="https://defcon.org/html/defcon-29/dc-29-index.html">DEF&nbsp;CON</a>
  and invited the assembled hacker elite to attack it. The
  SMACCMcopter was the <em>research vehicle</em> of the Air Team at
  DARPA's <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/research/programs/high-assurance-cyber-military-systems">HACMS</a>
  program. The Trustworthy Systems
  team <a href="https://trustworthy.systems/projects/OLD/SMACCM/">worked
    with project partners</a> to deploy seL4 and leverage formal
  methods to protect the drone from cyber attacks.

  The result? Predictably, sel4's verified security enforcement
  <a href="https://twitter.com/raymondrichards/status/1424230000144826372">defeated
    the hackers</a>
  comprehensively. As <a href="https://twitter.com/DARPA/status/1424752441900339200">DARPA
    said:</a> &ldquo;Formal methods FTW!&rdquo;
