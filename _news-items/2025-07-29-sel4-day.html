  On July 29, 2009, the last "sorry" of the seL4 functional correctness proof
  was eliminated. A "sorry" is an assumed theorem lacking a complete proof. "0
  sorries" meant there was nothing left to prove: the project was finished. We
  now celebrate this day every year to mark the seL4 day, when the world&apos;s
  first formally verified kernel with a machine-checked code-level proof came
  into existence.

<p>
  In July 2014, on the 29th to make the "seL4 day" a double-celebratory day,
  the seL4 code and proofs became open source, paving the way to the
  widespread <a href="{{ '/use.html' | relative_url }}">use</a>
  it enjoys today.

  A big thank-you to all for your continued support!
