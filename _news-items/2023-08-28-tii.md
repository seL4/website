The seL4 Foundation thanks [TII](https://www.tii.ae/) for becoming a Gold
sponsor of the [seL4 Summit 2023](../Foundation/Summit/2023).

The Technology Innovation Instituteâ€™s ([TII](https://www.tii.ae/)) Secure
Systems Research Centre ([SSRC](https://www.tii.ae/secure-systems)) aims to
drive end-to-end security and resilience in cyber-physical and autonomous
systems that will ensure safety. The research center adopts an applied research
approach, emphasizing practical applications. By employing seL4 as both a
microkernel and a hypervisor, SSRC seamlessly aligns its dedication to security
with the foundational technology crucial to achieving its objectives. This
critical technology forms the cornerstone of secure software stacks for diverse
edge devices, including secure communicators and drones. TII's research not only
contributes to but propels the evolution of cutting-edge high-end edge device
environments. TII's SSRC focus centers on resilience, isolation, trust, and
security, all with the intention of fostering a more secure digital landscape.
