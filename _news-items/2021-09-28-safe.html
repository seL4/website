  Following CSIRO's abandoning of Trustworthy Systems (TS) and the seL4
  technology TS developed, the seL4 community and the seL4 Foundation have grown
  a lot. This has led to concerns that the broader participation might have the
  potential to undermine the integrity of seL4. In his latest blog, <a
  href="https://microkerneldude.wordpress.com/2021/09/28/where-is-sel4-heading/">Gernot
  explains why there is no reason for such concern</a>. seL4's open governance
  and technical leadership is based on technical merit and established trust,
  not money.
