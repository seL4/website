This hybrid event will be held in Munich, Germany, 10-13 October 2022.

The seL4 summit will cover the complete seL4 ecosystem, consisting of the
verified microkernel, as well as all seL4-related technology, tools,
infrastructure, products, projects, and people.

**Tickets include:**

- Participation in the 3-day conference, including talks, keynotes, seL4 updates & discussions
- A one-day bootcamp with workshops and trainings
- Networking with other seL4 experts and enthusiasts
- Participation in the mentoring program (for students and junior engineers)

**Mentorship program**

As part of the registration process, attendees have the opportunity to opt-in to
a new, informal mentorship program. The purpose of this program is to foster
mentorship relationships within the seL4 community. The program committee will
match students and junior engineers who wish to participate as mentees with
volunteer mentors. Participating attendees will be introduced to their
counterparts during the summit, and will carry on afterwards with whatever level
of involvement suits both parties. Mentors are welcome to volunteer for any
level of involvement.
