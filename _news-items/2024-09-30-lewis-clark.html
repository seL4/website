    Lewis & Clark is a private, liberal arts college located in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. In our mathematical sciences department, we are pursuing the goal of making single-function connected devices more secure. Towards this end, we are proving a minimal, pure IPv6 networking stack implementation correct. We rely on seL4's infrastructure (i.e., microkernel, microkit, and device driver framework) as well as seL4's methodologies (e.g., proofs verified by Isabelle/HOL).
