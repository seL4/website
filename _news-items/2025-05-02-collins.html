<p>
  The seL4 Foundation thanks <a href="https://www.collinsaerospace.com">Collins
  Aerospace</a> for becoming a sponsor of the seL4 Summit 2025. Collins
  Aerospace has generously sponsored the seL4 summit every year since 2023.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.collinsaerospace.com">Collins Aerospace</a>, part of seL4
  Foundation member <a href="https://www.rtx.com">RTX</a>, has been a long-time
  core participant in the seL4 ecosystem. Collins was a prime contractor in the
  DARPA HACMS program which demonstrated the seL4-based incremental cyber
  retrofit of autonomous military vehicles. This was a major milestone in the
  growth of seL4, demonstrating that it protects against cyber attacks on real
  systems in operation. The same team also led the follow-on DARPA CASE program,
  aiming at designed-in cyber-resiliency, including the seL4-based framework for
  verified initialisation and configuration of systems architectures.
</p>
<p>
  Collins Aerospace is now leading a team on the DARPA PROVERS program which has
  a goal of enhancing the security of defense and aerospace systems by
  dramatically improving the usability, flexibility, and accessibility of formal
  methods-based development and verification tools, and targeting seL4 as an
  implementation platform.
