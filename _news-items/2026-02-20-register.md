We have an exciting new program for 2026! A full first day dedicated to applications, overviews, and perspectives on seL4-based systems and formally verified software in the real world. Followed by two days of technical talks and discussion on development, research, and experience reports.

If you're new to seL4 or still developing your familiarity with the technology, this is an ideal opportunity to get a high-level view of the landscape and ecosystem.

The [seL4 summit 2026](../Summit/2026) will be in Vancouver, Canada, on 1 - 3 September 2026.

Come hear about:
- vision, lessons-learned, roadmaps for verified software deployments;
- use-cases, deployments, experiences;
- walk-throughs and demos of tools, frameworks, systems;
- early work, crazy ideas, out-of-the-box thinking;
- technical progress, updates, breakthroughs.

And join us for one of the informal <mark>[social activities](TODO: link)</mark> on Monday 31 August 2026, for a fun gathering before the event starts!

If you have any cool work/idea/project/product related to seL4, don't forget to submit a [talk proposal](../Summit/2026/cfp.html).


Tickets include:

- Participation in the 3-day conference, including talks, keynotes, seL4 updates
  & discussions
