<p>
    The seL4 Foundation is pleased to welcome the <a

    <a href="{{ '/Foundation/Membership' | relative_url }}">Associate
    Member</a>.
</p>
<p>
    The Trusted Computing Center of Excellence™ (TCCoE) not-for-profit organization’s purpose is to lower barriers to adoption and facilitate the principled development and deployment of software and systems for which there is strong evidence of trustworthiness, including use of formal methods. Needs of the U.S. and allied defense, intelligence and security communities are our priorities. A major thrust is seL4®. While our colleagues at the seL4 Foundation focus on the code and formal proofs of the open source seL4® microkernel and closely related artifacts, the TCCoE focuses on curated software distributions (kernel, libraries, drivers, configurations, etc.) as bases of stable supported platforms on which to build trustworthy systems.
