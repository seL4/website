The [2022 ACM Software System Award](https://awards.acm.org/software-system)
recognises seL4 as the first industrial-strength, high-performance operating
system to have been the subject of a complete, mechanically-checked proof of
full functional correctness, proofs of enforcement of the core security
properties of integrity and confidentiality, a proof to the binary code of the
kernel, and the first sound and complete worst-case execution-time analysis of a
protected mode OS.

The award, recognising the development of a software system that has had a
lasting influence, goes to Gernot Heiser, University of New South Wales; Gerwin
Klein, Proofcraft; Harvey Tuch, Google; Kevin Elphinstone, University of New
South Wales; June Andronick, Proofcraft; David Cock, ETH Zurich; Philip Derrin,
Qualcomm; Dhammika Elkaduwe, University of Peradeniya; Kai Engelhardt; Toby
Murray, University of Melbourne; Rafal Kolanski, Proofcraft; Michael Norrish,
Australian National University; Thomas Sewell, University of Cambridge; and
Simon Winwood, Galois.

We are committed to make sure that seL4's recognised "lasting influence" live on
for the decades ahead!
