  The whitepaper "The seL4 Microkernel - An Introduction" provides an
  introduction to and overview of seL4. We explain what seL4 is (and
  is not) and explore its defining features. We explain what makes
  seL4 uniquely qualified as the operating-system kernel of choice
  for security- and safety- critical systems, and generally embedded
  and cyber-physical systems. In particular, we explain seL4's
  assurance story, its security- and safety-relevant features, and
  its benchmark-setting performance. We also discuss typical usage
  scenarios, including incremental cyber retrofit of legacy systems.
