Each year, DARPA leadership selects the Game Changer program that was the most
impactful in the preceding 10 years.

This year, the award goes to HACMS, the High-Assurance Cyber Military Systems
program, which has been instrumental in demonstrating how seL4 can be embedded
in real-world products (unmanned air and ground vehicles) and truly protect them
from cyber attacks.

The award was presented by DARPA Director Stefanie Tompkins to the three HACMS
program managers, Kathleen Fisher, John Launchbury, and Ray Richards. We truly
thank all three for their visionary leadership.

Our deep thanks to Darren Cofer as well, who masterfully lead the team, made of
Collins, Galois, Boeing, University of MN and the Trustworthy Systems group
(home of seL4 at the time) who demonstrated the technology on Boeing's Unmanned
Little Bird helicopter, including cyber attacks during flight!

A true _game changer_ indeed.
