<p>
  The <a href="{{ '/Foundation/index.html' | relative_url }}">seL4
  Foundation</a>, launched in 2020 as a project under the Linux Foundation, has
  benefited from early support in governance, trademarks, and operations. As the
  community has grown, the seL4 <a href="{{ '/Foundation/Board/index.html' |
  relative_url }}">Board</a> has determined that greater independence will better
  serve its members and long-term goals.
</p>

<p>
  To support broader outreach and stronger community engagement, the seL4
  Foundation has transitioned to a new, independent legal entity, established as
  a Swiss-registered non-profit association (Verein). The purpose, principles and
  internal structure remain unchanged. Switzerland was chosen for its neutrality
  and its well-established framework for international non-profits, a model also
  used by organizations such as RISC-V International.
</p>

<p>
  This strategic move is set to position the seL4 Foundation for continued
  growth and improved accessibility for its global community.
