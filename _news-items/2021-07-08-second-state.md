The seL4 Foundation [Second State](https://secondstate.io) as a member.

Second State is the creator and maintainer of WasmEdge, a CNCF / Linux
Foundation project, which provides a high-performance, lightweight,
cross-platform, polyglot, and secure software runtime/sandbox for edge
computing. Based on the WebAssembly standard, WasmEdge could be 100 times faster
than Docker and hypervisor-based solutions. It supports multiple programming
languages, including DSLs, and can be embedded into multiple hosting
environments.

Second State is currently porting WasmEdge to seL4. It will be one of the first
software runtimes in the seL4 ecosystem. By working with members in the seL4
Foundation, Second State aims to create a real-time software sandbox for
automotive and industrial (ie smart factories) applications.
