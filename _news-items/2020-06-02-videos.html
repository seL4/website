Yet another contribution of [UNSW Sydney](https://www.unsw.edu.au) to the seL4
community: This year Gernot Heiser is making the seL4-related videos from his
UNSW Advanced Operating Systems class freely available. You'll find them at the
[UNSW CSeLearning COMP9242 YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbSaCpDlfd6qLbEsKquVo3--0gwYBmrUV).

At present there are the first two modules, which provide some background on
microkernels and seL4, and discuss the seL4 API. More material will show up over
the next two months.

The complete course material, including all lecture slides, the project spec and
code, are available, as always, from the [COMP9042 web
site](https://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9242/current/).
