The seL4 Foundation is pleased to welcome the Technology Innovation Institute.

Technology Innovation Institute's (TII) Secure Systems Research Centre (SSRC)
has obtained seL4 Foundation membership that will enable the Centre to
participate in and contribute to driving the open source for a robust
hypervisor technology. The critical technology will help build a secure
software stack for many edge devices, such as secure communicators and
drones. Through the membership, TII will research, contribute to and advance
next-generation high-end edge device environments that focus on resilience,
isolation, trust, and security.
