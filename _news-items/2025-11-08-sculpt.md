Genode Labs have released <a
href="https://genodians.org/alex-ab/2025-11-02-sculpt-multi-kernel">Sculpt
OS 25.10</a> with an (unofficial and experimental) variant running on
seL4. Sculpt is a general-purpose OS that combines Genode&#39;s
microkernel architecture, capability-based security, sandboxed
device drivers, and virtual machines in a novel operating system
for commodity PC hardware and the PinePhone. Sculpt is used as
day-to-day OS by the Genode developers.
