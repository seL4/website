Our second Annual General Meeting (AGM) 6 April 2022. As our membership now is
truly global, covering New Zealand, Australia, China, the Middle East, Central
and Western Europe, the US East, Central and West coasts, there is no time that
is not in the middle of the night for some members. Hence we will hold the AGM
in two sessions:

- 2022-04-06 07:00 - 08:30 UTC
- 2022-04-06 23:00 - 2022-04-07 00:30 UTC
