      seL4 is both the world's most highly assured and the world's fastest
      operating system kernel. Its uniqueness lies in the formal mathematical
      proof that it behaves exactly as specified, enforcing strong security
      boundaries for applications running on top of it while maintaining the
      high performance that deployed systems need.
    </p>
    <p>
      seL4 is grounded in research breakthroughs across multiple science
      disciplines. These breakthroughs have been recognised by international
      acclaimed awards, from the MIT Technology Review Award, to the ACM Hall
      of Fame Award, the ACM Software Systems Award, the DARPA Game changer
      award, and more.

      <p>
        seL4 protects critical systems from software failures and
        cyber-attacks. It allows non-critical functionality to run securely
        alongside critical payloads by enforcing strong isolation and controlled
        communication.
      </p>
      <p>
        seL4 is used in a wide range of critical sectors, from automotive,
        aerospace and IoT to data distribution, military and intelligence. It
        has been successfully retrofitted into complex critical systems and has
        demonstrably prevented cyber-attacks. Government organisations on
        several continents have funded further development of seL4 and its
        ecosystem.

        Frameworks, tools and components that run on top of seL4 can use seL4&apos;s
        formally verified protection mechanisms and are therefore easier to

        seL4 ecosystem:
      </p>

        seL4 itself is expanding its support for an increasing range
        of platforms, architectures, configurations and features.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ecosystem is expanding with the development of frameworks,
        tools, components and language support to facilitate the production of
        seL4-based systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        The formal proofs, which make seL4 unique, evolve alongside seL4.
        They are constantly maintained, improved, and kept in
        lock-step with the seL4 code.
