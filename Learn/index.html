<h1 id="learn-about-sel4">Learn about seL4</h1>

<h2 id="docsite">Docsite</h2>

<p>
  We have a separate website for technical seL4 documentation, which
  we call the <a href="https://docs.sel4.systems/">Docsite</a>. The
  docsite is community maintained - its source is hosted on GitHub and
  can be edited using standard GitHub procedures
  as <a href="https://docs.sel4.systems/processes/docs-contributing.html">documented</a>
  on the docsite itself.
</p> 

<h2 id="tutorials">Tutorials</h2>

<p>
  The best way to learn to use seL4 is to follow our tutorials. We
  provide a series of hands-on tutorials that cover the basics of
  seL4, the kernel and core library APIs, user-level frameworks, and
  virtualisation.
</p>

<p>
  If you want to know how to use seL4, then this is where you should
  start. See
  the <a href="https://docs.sel4.systems/Tutorials/">Tutorials</a>
  page on our docsite.
</p>

<p>
  If you prefer unstructured learning and want to dive in and explore
  on your own then follow the links on the
  docsite's <a href="https://docs.sel4.systems/GettingStarted.html">Getting
    Started</a> page.
</p>

<p>
  After getting a solid seL4 background you can move on to building
  seL4-based systems. Next steps include working on one of
  our <a href="https://docs.sel4.systems/SuggestedProjects.html">suggested
  projects</a> or helping to expand
  the <a href="https://docs.sel4.systems/projects/available-user-components.html">collection
  of libraries and components</a> available to build seL4-based
  systems.
</p>

<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>

<p>
  We've written a lot about the seL4 kernel: from overview papers,
  historical background, and project retrospectives, to detailed
  documentation of the kernel API, user-level libraries and
  components, and system frameworks.
</p>

<p>
  Besides the kernel implementation and the systems aspects of seL4,
  we've also written about the seL4 proofs: from overview papers
  explaining the models and the proofs, details of proof techniques
  developed and used for the proof, insights gained through doing the
  proofs, to detailed documentation of the proofs themselves.
</p>

<p>
  See
  the <a href="https://docs.sel4.systems/projects/sel4/documentation.html">Documentation</a>
  page on our docsite for information about all of these.
</p>


<h2 id="courses">Courses</h2>

<p>
  seL4 is being used as the basis of several (University-level)
  courses, including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9242/current/">Advanced
      Operating Systems</a> at UNSW. This course provides an extensive
      seL4-based assignment that teaches students how to build an
      operating system on seL4. The course material (all lecture slides, the
      project and related code) are publicly available. Videos of lectures covering seL4 are available from the
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbSaCpDlfd6qLbEsKquVo3--0gwYBmrUV">UNSW
	CSeLearning COMP9242 YouTube channel</a>.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li><p>
      <a href="https://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs4161/">Advanced Topics
      in Software Verification</a> at UNSW. While not directly about
      seL4, this course teaches Isabelle/HOL and the program
      verification techniques used to develop seL4's proof. Following
      this, or a similar, course is necessary if you intend to
      contribute to the seL4 proofs.
