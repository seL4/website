      This website runs on <a href="https://lionsos.org">LionsOS</a>,
      an operating system for embedded systems.  LionsOS is in turn
      based on
      the <a href="https://github.com/seL4/microkit">Microkit</a>, a
      framework that presents a small set of simple abstractions over
      seL4, and
      the <a href="https://trustworthy.systems/projects/drivers">sel4
      Device Driver Framework</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Source for the system is
      in <a href="https://github.com/au-ts/lionsos">the LionsOS</a>
      repository.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hardware is
      an <a href="https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/odroid-c4/">Odroid
      C4</a>, a quad-core Cortex A55 running at 1.2GHz with 4G of DDR4
      RAM and a Gigabit ethernet.  We are using only one of the cores.
    </p>
    <p>
      For ease of update, the website content is stored on an NFS
      server.  It is built from content
      on <a href="https://github.com/seL4/website">github.com</a> and
      deployed to the NFS server as updates are accepted into the
      tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      The MicroPython code that actually implements the webserver is
      based on
      the <a href="https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/microdot">Microdot</a>
      framework.  It uses asychronous access to network and
      filesystems.
