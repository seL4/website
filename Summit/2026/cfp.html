        The <a href="./">seL4 Summit</a> aims at gathering the seL4 community to
        <strong>learn</strong>, <strong>share</strong>, and <strong>connect</strong>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>learn</strong> about the seL4 technology, its latest progress, use,
          successes, challenges, plans;
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>share</strong> exciting seL4 development, research, experience,
          applications in the real world;
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>connect</strong> with other seL4 developers, users, providers,
          supporters, potential partners, and enthusiasts.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The seL4 Summit covers the complete seL4 ecosystem, consisting of the verified
        microkernel, as well as all seL4-related technology, tools, infrastructure,
        products, projects, and people.
      </p>
      <p>
        The seL4 Summit 2026 will be in Vancouver, Canada.

        The 2026 edition of the seL4 summit will feature a full first day
      dedicated to applications of seL4-based systems, high-level overviews of the
      technology, and perspectives on formally verified software in the real world.
      This will be followed by Days 2 and 3 focusing on more technical development,
      research, reports, and discussions.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-25">
        We are particularly keen to welcome people who are new to seL4 or still
        developing their familiarity with the technology. The event will offer an
        ideal opportunity to gain a high-level view of the landscape and ecosystem
        of seL4 and its associated tools, frameworks and languages, as well as
        formally verified software in general, and to take stock of the latest
        updates.
