  Using LionsOS
</strong></p>

  10:00 - 12:30
</p>
<p>
  LionsOS is a new Operating Systems developed at Trustworthy Systems aimed at embedded, IoT, and cyberphysical
  systems. LionsOS is based on the seL4 Microkit and is designed to formally verifiable, performant, and adaptable
  to a wide class of use-cases.
</p>
<p>
  LionsOS, by design, is not a conventional OS and hence it may be overwhelming for users who want to get started
  and are not familiar with the ideas and goals of LionsOS.
</p>
<p>
  This hands-on tutorial aims to ease people into creating a LionsOS-based system. We will be using the components
  and tools provided by LionsOS to, step-by-step, transform a minimal boilerplate system to a functional system
  involving various drivers, virtual machines and other components.

  Rust has been an officially supported language for use in seL4 userspace since last year&apos;s summit. In this
  workshop, participants will be led through a tutorial that demonstrates how to leverage Rust and its ecosystem
  to rapidly build memory-safe components for seL4-based systems. This tutorial will cover a range of scenarios,
  including <a href="https://docs.sel4.systems/projects/microkit/">Microkit</a> protection domains as well as
  building on seL4 directly.
