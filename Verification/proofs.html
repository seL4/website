<div class="theprose">
<p>
  The seL4 proofs span the following top-level properties.
</p>

<div class="mx-auto w-4/5 pl-2 aspect-2/1">

<ul class="mt-10 space-y-8 text-light">
  {% include green-tick-li.html
      bold="Functional correctness:"
      text="the C code of all verified
      configurations of seL4 behaves precisely as specified in the seL4
      specification and nothing more.
      This is the strongest assurance that the code will not have any
      unspecified behaviour."
  %}
  {% include green-tick-li.html
      bold="Binary correctness:"
      text="in the configurations that support this property, the binary machine
      code running on the processor correctly implements the behaviour of the C code assumed
      in the functional correctness proof. By extension, this means the binary code
      implements precisely the behaviour of the specification, and nothing more."
  %}
  {% include green-tick-li.html
      bold="Security:"
      text="
      in the configurations that support this property, the specification, and
      by extension the kernel code, prevents an application running on top of seL4
      from modifying data without authorisation (integrity), from interfering
      with resource access of other applications (availability), and from
      learning information from other applications without explicit authorisation
      (confidentiality). Together these security properties enforce the
      <strong>isolation</strong> of components running on top of the kernel,
      allowing critical components to securely run alongside untrusted
      software."
  %}
  {% include green-tick-li.html
      bold="System initialisation:"
      text="
      the proofs above show that seL4 provides strong security &mdash; when used
      correctly. The security theorem statements provide requirements on how
      the system must be set up. For instance, for integrity to hold, isolated
      components cannot be given write access to each other, and confidentiality holds
      between security domains of seL4's domain scheduler, not between arbitrary
      threads. In the configurations that support verified system
      initialisation, the seL4 proof stack has further parts that help with the
      task of setting up systems correctly: the <em>capDL</em> specification
      language that lets developers describe access control configurations
      statically, and the user-level <em>system initialiser</em> that takes
      those descriptions, and automatically configures the system to provably
      conform to them at boot time."
  %}
</ul>

<p>
  Note that not all properties are available on all platforms and all
  configurations. See the list of
  <a href="https://docs.sel4.systems/projects/sel4/verified-configurations.html">verified
  configurations</a> for the current status of what is available.
</p>
<p>
  The properties listed above are what the proofs show directly. A side effect
  of the strength of these statements is that they also imply that <strong>seL4
  is free from whole classes of common programming errors such as buffer
  overflows, null pointer dereferences, memory leaks, arithmetic exceptions or
  undefined behaviour</strong>. See the page on <a
  href="implications.html">proof implications</a> for more.
</p>
<p>
  As with all proofs, there are still <a href="assumptions.html">assumptions</a>
  that must be met, and there may still be user expectations on kernel behaviour
  that are not captured by the properties proved so far. Nevertheless, this
  degree of strong evidence for security and correct functionality has never
  been achieved before for an OS kernel and is still unrivalled.

<div class="theprose">

<p>
  We claim that seL4 has world's highest level of assurance for an operating
  system kernel. On the research level, this is substantiated by the following
  facts:
</p>
<ul class="mt-6 space-y-8 text-light">
  {% include green-tick-li.html
      text='formal verification in general is stronger than other
      traditional ways of gaining trust in software such as testing in that
      it can prove the <em>absence</em> of bugs, not just their
      presence.'
  %}
  {% include green-tick-li.html
      text='within systems that are claimed to be formally verified,
      seL4&apos;s proof stack goes down to the binary code. This massively
      reduces the <a href="assumptions.html">assumptions</a> it relies
      on, compared to verification projects where the system model
      stays at a more abstract level.'
  %}
  {% include green-tick-li.html
      text='within existing formal verification approaches, the seL4 proofs
      target strong properties, such as functional correctness and explicit
      security theorems. More traditional techniques such as static analysis
      often only target the absence of specific classes of programming errors,
      which are <a href="implications.html">implied</a> by the seL4 proofs.'
  %}
  {% include green-tick-li.html
      text='within tools that can be used for formal machine-checked proof,
      the seL4 proofs use the proof
      assistant <a href="https://isabelle.in.tum.de">Isabelle/HOL</a>,
      which is engineered to minimise the code that needs to trusted for
      the proof to be correct &mdash; see more on
      the <a href="assumptions.html">assumptions</a> page.'
  %}
</ul>
<p>
  This means in all dimensions of measuring the strength of formal verification,
  detail of model, depth of property, and correctness of the prover, seL4 is on
  the highest levels.
</p>
<p>
  All these arguments are nice, but they are abstract. There is something more
  concrete: we can measure how strong these proofs are in practice.
</p>
<p>
  Before we turn to seL4 itself, there is a <a
  href="https://users.cs.utah.edu/~regehr/papers/pldi11-preprint.pdf">research
  paper</a> about <em>Finding and Understanding Bugs in C Compilers</em> that
  makes empirical observations about the CompCert C compiler. Like seL4,
  CompCert also comes with a functional correctness proof, and this is what the
  authors find:
</p>

<blockquote>
    The striking thing about our CompCert results is that the middle-end
    bugs we found in all other compilers are absent. As of early 2011,
    the under-development version of CompCert is the only compiler we
    have tested for which Csmith cannot find wrong-code errors. This is
    not for lack of trying: we have devoted about six CPU-years to the
    task.
</blockquote>


<p>
  Now turning towards seL4, there are test suites in addition to the
  formal verification:  one for <a
  href="https://github.com/seL4/sel4bench/">performance tests</a>
  and one for <a href="https://github.com/seL4/sel4test">functional tests</a>.
</p>
<p>Why have these if there is formal verification? Here are some of the classes
  that are still interesting to test:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Code in the verified kernel that is left as
    an <a href="assumptions.html">assumption</a>, e.g. machine interfaces such
    as caching. These can be tested and have a fairly high density of tests.
  </li>

  <li>
    Code in unverified configurations of the kernel — things that are either not yet
    verified or are only for debugging or are for platforms/configuration
    combinations that are unverified.
  </li>

  <li>
    Tests for verified code to confirm expectations: this is testing the
    specification. It is less about coverage, more about usability and
    confirming that the API is what the developers were intending, as opposed to
    what the specification says or what is implemented. It is also helpful when
    such tests break on code changes before these are verified.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  In addition to the test suites, there are also integration tests with various
  user-level libraries and frameworks to make sure that they still work (or are
  updated appropriately) when we make a change to the kernel API.
</p>

<p>
  This means there are a lot of tests that run frequently, hundreds for every
  code change. seL4 also has been in continued deployment for over a decade.
  This gives us some data.
</p>

<p>
  In all this time, <strong>there have been no functional correctness defects in
  verified code since the functional correctness proof completed in 2009</strong>
  &mdash; more than 15 years of tests, use, and deployment. There have also
  never been any integrity defects in verified code since the integrity proofs
  finished, and so on.
</p>

<p>
  To contrast how remarkable 0 defects in 15 years are: defect density in
  unverified configurations of seL4 is overall lower than in normal software,
  but it is not zero. This means there have been defects discovered even in
  mature unverified configurations of the kernel (e.g. multicore SMP, or x64
  VT-x virtualisation extensions), and even in verified configurations we have
  detected small defects in every class of unverified code in the kernel in that
  time &mdash; hardware assumptions, compiler assumptions, unverified boot code.
  As the saying goes: everything that can go wrong will eventually go wrong. All
  the more remarkable that in the entire 10,000 lines of verified code
  <strong>nothing</strong> has gone wrong in all that time. This is not
  surprising, we have a proof for that after all, but it can be hard to grasp.
