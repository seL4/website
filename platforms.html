<p>
  seL4 is available for a wide range of platforms on Arm, RISC-V, and Intel
  architectures. The kernel is intended to run on hardware ranging from small IoT
  boards to server class machines, with current focus on the embedded space.

    seL4 runs on the following hardware:
  </p>
  <ul>
    {% for platform in site.data.platforms %}
      <li><strong>{{ platform[0] }}</strong>:
        {% for name in platform[1] %}
        {{ name }}{% unless forloop.last %},{% endunless %}
        {% endfor %}
      </li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
  <p>
    Virtualisation and SMP multicore support is available on most of these
    boards. Note that the formal verification does not apply to all
    configurations and platforms. For details on the exact feature and verification
    support status see the <a
    href="https://docs.sel4.systems/Hardware/">detailed supported platforms
    list</a>
    on the seL4 docsite.
  </p>
  <p>
    QEMU simulator support is available for all of the architectures above.
