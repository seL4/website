    This talk will give an overview of the status of ongoing and planned research and development at Trustworthy Systems to expand the scope of proofs about seL4-based operating systems in two directions: (1) downwards, to prove that the seL4 kernel implements time protection correctly at the abstract and C specification levels, and (2) upwards, to prove functional specifications of seL4's system calls and on that basis carry out SMT-based automated deductive verification of the user-level seL4 Microkit and Lions OS service components built on top of it. Here I will lay out the research and engineering challenges facing us on both these fronts and the planned subprojects for which we seek talented PhD students, postdocs and engineers to tackle them.
