    At the heart of every modern server platform sits an embedded system called theboard management controller (BMC) that is responsible for the low-levelfunctioning of the platform. Despite their critical nature, they are generallynot built as trustworthy systems. We have embarked on a journey tocyber-retrofit BMC firmware with seL4 as the kernel. In this talk, we present anupdate on our efforts -- generate trustworthy hardware/software I2C drivers. I2C is a low-level protocol used by BMCs to communicate with many peripherals(e.g. the power regulators). Unlike memory-mapped devices with one-to-oneinterfaces with the BMC, multiple I2C devices may share the same bus. Quirks ofone device can influence the whole assemblage. Therefore, to produce a correctdriver for I2C (and other bus-based protocols), we need to consider thespecifications of not only the controller but all devices on the bus.

    We present Efeu, a framework that allows us to specify both the host-side driverand the peripherals. The specifications are composed of layers, which enableefficient modeling of different devices (including those with quirks). Theentire system is then model-checked using SPIN to ensure interoperability. Fromthat, Efeu generates trustworthy drivers in software and hardware. The softwareimplementations target seL4, but could also address other operating systems.Furthermore, when I2C communication speed or CPU usage is a concern, Efeu allowsgenerating hybrid hardware/software drivers, where the hardware part can bematerialized on programmable hardware such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays(FPGAs). We evaluated Efeu-generated I2C stacks on a Zynq MPSoC and show thatmodel-checking the whole system and generating the full stack is not onlypractical but that the resulting implementations can saturate the I2C bus andachieve competitive performance with off-the-shelf solutions.
