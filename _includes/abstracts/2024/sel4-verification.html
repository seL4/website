    seL4 Verification: Status and Plans

    Presented by Gerwin Klein, <span class="summit-abstract-affiliation">Proofcraft</span>
</p>
<p>
    In this talk we will give an overview of Proofcraft's recent milestones, as well as ongoing and future plans for the formal verification of seL4 to support more platforms, architectures, configurations, and features.
</p>
<p>
    In particular, we will report on the completion of the functional correctness proof of seL4 on AArch64. AArch64 is now on par with Arm 32-bit, RISC-V 64-bit and Intel x86 64-bit with respect to functional correctness, the strongest assurance that can be given about the correctness of software. Functional correctness is also the cornerstone of even stronger overall assurance, such as the security properties of integrity and confidentiality, which are next inseL4's AArch64 verification roadmap.
</p>
<p>
    We will further report on where the verification of the seL4 extensions for mixed-criticality systems (MCS) is at, and share our plans for DARPA's PROVERS program where, as part of the INSPECTA team, we are aiming at increasing verification automation and scope while reducing the reliance on formal methods experts.
