    We introduce Pancake, a new language for verifiable, low-level systems programming, especially device drivers. Pancake features a simple type system that makes it attractive to systems programmers, while at the same time aiming to ease the formal verification of code. Pancake has well-defined semantics which the compiler is proven to preserve, meaning that each generated binary code preserves the semantics of its original program. We have now extended Pancake with the shared memory capability which allows the programs to access device registers without escaping to C.

    We present the design of the language and its verified compiler, as well as demonstrating its usability, performance and current limitations through case studies of device drivers and related systems components for an seL4-based operating system.
