Formal methods have been successfully deployed at scale in production environments at large internet
companies, but barriers remain to their adoption by defense companies developing national security
systems. The goal of the INSPECTA project (part of the DARPA PROVERS program which has just started
in 2024) is to improve the security of defense and aerospace systems by dramatically improving the
usability, flexibility, and accessibility of formal methods-based development and verification tools. We
will leverage memory-safe programming languages (Rust), a provably secure microkernel (seL4), and new
formal methods tools and make them accessible to the defense industry workforce. These open source
technologies will be integrated into an aerospace CertDevOps workflow automation processes and
applied to the development of mission critical systems to demonstrate their usability, practicality, and
eﬀectiveness. We will demonstrate the tools and workflow by addressing emerging security
requirements for the Air Launched Eﬀects (ALE) mission computing platform. This will include re-
architecting the mission sotfware as a collection of virtual machines running legacy code and selected
high-criticality components, producing an architecture model for the system, porting selected software
to Rust, building software to run on seL4, and verifying critical safety and security properties. This
presentation will provide an overview of the PROVERS program objectives, the INSPECTA workflow to be
developed, and the assurance evidence to be produced.
