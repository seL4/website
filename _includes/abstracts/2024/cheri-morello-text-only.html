    seL4 currently provides, formally verified, memory safety guarantees in the kernel and isolation guarantees between seL4's userspace tasks, but there is no safety within a single seL4 task or protection domain itself (e.g., VMs or single-address-space servers such as rumprun). According to a recent Microsoft study, memory safety vulnerabilities account for 70% of all software vulnerabilities. CHERI is a capability-based hardware-software architecture aiming to address memory-safety and software compartmentalisation issues. The goal of this project is to have a complete memory-safe C/C++ seL4-based software stack using CHERI on Morello, without having to re-write the existing seL4 C/C++ userspace libraries (currently over 250 KLoC, using sloc tool) from scratch or formally verify them. This talk will describe the progress of CHERIfying the existing seL4's userspace in order to have complete (spatial) memory and pointer safety.
