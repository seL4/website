    ROS (Robotic Operating System), a modular componentized architecture for robot applications, has made it possible to quickly develop and deploy systems utilizing autonomous or human guided robots.  Focusing on ease of use and portability, ROS has enabled a community of developers to create autonomy solutions that were previously restricted to well-funded companies.  However, ROS depends on many services included in a full Linux distribution to function properly.  Beyond the Operating System itself, these distributions contain many unvetted software packages, which when used in high assurance environments, such as factory automation, could present an unacceptable amount of overhead and potential vulnerabilities.

    Even in less critical environments, a compromised robot could surreptitiously spy on an end user or subtly/overtly cause harm to the environment in which it operates.  While securing such systems with seL4 seems like an obvious solution, the lack of support for common software APIs and middleware presents a significant hurdle. Once this is overcome wider adoption of seL4 and more resilient robotic systems would be enabled.  This presentation will show how the cyber-retrofit approach is being used to enable secure autonomous operation of an x86 based ground vehicle, how this approach is being extended to enable native seL4 ROS applications, and the barriers to further system hardening.
