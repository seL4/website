    In 2017 Cog Systems developed a single domain virtualized device on an HTC One A9 smartphone, and successfully validated it against the National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) Protection Profile (PP) for Mobile Device Fundamentals (MDF) and registered the device with the National Security Agency (NSA) as an Approved Component under its Commercial Solutions for Classified (CSfC) process. In the past few years we have been building the next-gen version of this solution.

    At the 2020 seL4 Summit, Cog Systems presented this effort as a case study in applying seL4 to a product commercialization effort. Since then, the project has experienced multiple and varied challenges, and has not yet been completed. At the 2023 Summit we gave a follow-up presentation detailing the progress, setbacks, and lessons learned of the past few years. Now, in the 2024 continuation of the series, Cog Systems will provide an update and share some of the technical, logistical, and financial challenges we encountered while building a commercial smartphone product with seL4.
