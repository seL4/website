    Upstream hypervisor support has expanded in recent years to support additional configurations on x86, ARM, and RISC-V. Every upstream example simply runs Linux, which is an excellent use case for highly functional, general purpose computing platforms, however there are other guest Operating Systems that solve different use cases. Running seL4 in Hypervisor mode allows for the untrusted code in Linux to be sandboxed and isolated from trusted components in the system. What if the guest Operating System was fully trusted? Deos is a DO-178C DAL A certified RTOS for Avionics Applications, an area seL4 has struggled to break into. DornerWorks expanded seL4 Hypervisor support to run Deos under the CAmkES VM. This presentation will overview the changes that needed to be made to support a certifiable RTOS guest, how a Hypervisor effects the safety certification considerations of Deos, and the next steps needed to create a certifiable system with seL4.
