    Container solutions have been instrumental throughout cloud computing, influencing how developers build and automate their application deployments. A core benefit behind containers is that they provide a standardised abstraction layer of an application's underlying OS infrastructure. These abstractions help isolate an application's code and system dependencies, whilst conveniently packaging said dependencies into images that can be easily revision controlled and managed in CI/CD pipelines. When applying this technology to embedded systems, containers offer the potential for simplifying application development workflows, whilst also providing a useful CI/CD mechanism for deploying software updates to deployed devices. seL4 is uniquely suited to power a modern generation of embedded devices and using containers brings with it modern software development practices that makes it easier to manage fleets of devices.

    Deploying containers on embedded systems is not necessarily new and has been demonstrated across various embedded Linux deployments. At Kry10 we recognise the value of using containers and see the conveniences it can bring to a developers workflow and the capabilities it provides for developing update-able and maintainable systems. We've implemented first-class container support in Kry10 OS that allows developers to define and package native and VM-based applications. In this talk, I'll present the design and implementation behind our seL4-based container support. I'll step through how container builds are used to package and deploy different types of applications on Kry10 OS, starting from simple native applications, and as the needs and runtime requirements of the application grow, moving onto more complex microVM-style applications.
