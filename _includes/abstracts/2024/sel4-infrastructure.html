<p>
    Since 2021, a small team at Capgemini have been making contributions toward the seL4
infrastructure, assisting developers in getting started with seL4.
Previously, building atop CAmkES, we presented a Developer Kit (from zero to "hello world"), a
framework to access the U-boot driver suite, and initial efforts in preparing a native xHCI driver
(USB 3.0).
</p>
<p>
    Now, we present the conclusion of these efforts. We transition our entire suite of contributions
from CAmkES to Microkit. A greater range of USB device classes are now supported. A simple
native HDMI driver is introduced. And we leverage sDDF and VMM, in permitting the secure
routing of a selected physical USB device into a guest host. While our primary focus has been
the Avnet MaaXBoard, many of these contributions would be readily portable to other
platforms.
</p>
<p>
    More generally, as our focus on seL4 infrastructure reaches a conclusion, we describe our
journey with seL4 thus far, summarising our overall contributions and experiences.
