    When a digital system is undergoing cyber attack or is failing in some way, it is often necessary to take action different from its usual operating mode. These alternative modes of operation are called Reserve Modes.
</p>
<p>
    There are several challenges in implementing reserve modes in systems. The first challenge is developing a mechanism for defining and loading all modes into a system at boot time and enabling alternative modes as necessary. The second challenge is making these changes without affecting or disturbing parts of the system not involved in the reserve modes. The final and hardest challenge is being able to perform such system level changes with assurance that the reserve modes will be enabled as required and operate as expected, without modification.
</p>
<p>
    This presentation introduces Assured Reserve Modes on the seL4-based Kry10 OS. Assured Reserve Modes are a mechanism for providing reserved modes that successfully address the above challenges - implementing reserved mode functionality and providing assurance that they work correctly.  We explain the concept of reserve modes and provide examples of reserve modes and their benefits, present the Assured Reserve Mode design and implementation, and discuss how to provide the assurance that they require.
