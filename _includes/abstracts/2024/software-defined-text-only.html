    The automotive industry is rapidly evolving, with software-defined vehicles (SDVs) at the forefront of this transformation. At NIO, we are leveraging the seL4 microkernel to redefine vehicle architecture, ensuring robust safety, reliability, and performance. This presentation will explore the vision behind integrating seL4 into our SDV platform. We will share the journey of delivering the seL4-based SkyOS-M within the ONVO vehicle on our latest NT3 platform, highlight the significant impact this integration has had on our vehicle design and functionality, and outline our future roadmap beyond the current launch.
