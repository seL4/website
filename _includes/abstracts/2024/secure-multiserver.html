    Several frameworks, such as CAmkES and the seL4 Microkit, have been built on top of seL4 to enable the development of performant and provably secure operating systems. Most of these have static architectures and use system descriptions that define a complete system including all components and the resources they can access. The system specification is then passed to tools like CapDL, which generate the described system with the correct capability distribution. An important attribute of frameworks like CAmkES and Microkit is that they do not allow this initial distribution to evolve, preventing the runtime transmission of capabilities within an initialized system. This makes them well-suited for static analysis and verification, but comes with the caveat that some behaviours become more difficult or even impossible to represent. In particular, static frameworks are unsuitable for dynamic systems that adhere to complex security policies, especially ones that depend on runtime behaviour, or require functionality such as the ability to create new, sandboxed components, or temporarily transfer privileges between components at runtime.

    The Secure Multiserver Operating System (SMOS) project aims to create a secure, dynamic OS framework on top of seL4. Our goal is to enable the development of systems as dynamic as mainstream operating systems like Linux, that allow you to, for example, download and run arbitrary executables, while leveraging the security properties of seL4 to ensure that a global security policy is always correctly upheld. This talk will focus on the key principles behind the design of SMOS, the progress we have made on its implementation, and an overview of some of the challenges we have encountered, both in development and in correctly enforcing a variety of arbitrary, often complex security policies at runtime.
