    The utilization of seL4, a high-assurance microkernel, in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) on RISC-V hardware, presents a robust solution for secure computing. This year, we build upon our foundational work with new insights into the performance impacts and enhancements of our TEE.

<p>
    We present empirical data on the CPU, memory, and I/O performance impacts of having a seL4 TEE on a PolarFire RISC-V platform and run different TEE services performance measurements. The insights into performance nuances, such as the minimal overhead introduced by the seL4 TEE and its operational efficiency in handling cryptographic tasks, solidify the practical benefits of our architecture. Furthermore, we outline ongoing advancements and future directions in enhancing the seL4-based TEE.
