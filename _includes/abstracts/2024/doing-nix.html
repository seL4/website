    Compiling the seL4 kernel itself might be simple, but once more and more of the seL4 ecosystem is involved, transitive dependencies from Python to Haskell complicate things. To tackle this complexity, we added yet another layer on top, a declarative build system that allows to provide all the (transitive-) dependencies from one hand: Nix.

<p>
    This talk introduces you to the seL4-nix-utils, a collection of Nix expressions to compile but also ease integration and project bring-up with seL4. After a brief introduction to the mechanism behind Nix, we outline the provided Nix expressions and their use-cases. The talk closes with a list of remaining pain-points and a reference to a hands-on you may try after the talk.
