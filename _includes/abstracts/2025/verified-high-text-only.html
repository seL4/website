  We report on our effort to verify a high-performance, portable, pure IPv6
  network stack written in C. Currently, our stack includes compliant
  implementations of the Ethernet, IPv6, UDP, and ICMPv6 layers. Our
  verification efforts center on showing our C implementation is a refinement of
  an abstract specification manually derived from official prose-based
  specifications. We developed our proof with Isabelle/HOL using the AutoCorres2
  framework.
