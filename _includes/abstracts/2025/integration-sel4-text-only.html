  The goal of the INSPECTA project (part of the DARPA PROVERS program which
  started in 2024) is to  improve the security of defense and aerospace systems
  by dramatically improving the usability,  flexibility, and accessibility of
  formal methods-based development and verification tools. We will  demonstrate
  the formal methods tools and workflow developed on the program by addressing
  emerging  security requirements for the mission computing platform that
  Collins has developed for the US Army Launched Effects (LE) unmanned air
  vehicles. This includes re-architecting the mission software as a  collection
  of virtual machines running legacy code and selected high-criticality
  components, producing  an architecture model for the system, porting selected
  software to Rust, building software to run on  seL4, and verifying critical
  safety and security properties.

  The team has completed our initial integration of seL4 with LE mission system
  software. The integrated  software was  able to successfully execute in
  hardware-in-the-loop simulation one of the autonomous  multi-UAV missions
  flown last year at the Army's EDGE24 event. The Collins RapidEdge
  Collaborative  Mission Autonomy software was run without modification in a
  secure virtual machine hosted on seL4,  providing guaranteed isolation and
  control over all input and output interfaces.

  This successful integration and demonstration provide the basis for further
  application of formal  methods technologies in the coming phases of the
  PROVERS program and will result in verified cyber resilience for the LE
  mission system. In addition to describing the integration and test effort, we
  will  report on lessons learned, gaps identified, and next steps for the
  project.
