  Embedded systems are increasingly targeted by both criminal and nation state
  actors. One particularly challenging subdomain for embedded systems is space,
  posing additional concerns in the form of a harsh environment (e.g., radiation
  and temperature), inability to get physical access once launched, and tight
  coupling between hardware and software. Satellites need resilient software to
  face these challenges and yet software security has received little
  consideration to date.

  As a result, several years ago we ported NASAâ€™s core Flight Software (cFS) to
  seL4 to provide a secure foundation for satellite systems. cFS was developed
  by NASA Goddard over 20 years ago and is now widely deployed for scores of
  space missions (e.g., NASA Artemis, the Roman Space Telescope). Our analysis
  of cFS and its assumptions about its host OS led us to conclude that despite
  expected porting ease with the OS abstraction layer, significant functionality
  needed to be created on top of seL4.

  This talk will focus on our analysis of the features required for cFS, our
  experience implementing that functionality and porting cFS to an seL4-based
  system, and how this led us to create the initial Magnetite operating system.
