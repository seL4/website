  Using seL4, we can build systems that include both critical and untrusted
  user-space  components, with high confidence that there can be no unintended
  interactions  between components. But how do we gain confidence that critical
  components and  their composition correctly implement system requirements? To
  answer this, Kry10 is  developing a framework for verifying systems of
  user-space components running on  seL4.
</p>
<p>
We have several goals for our framework:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Write specifications as abstract programs, and prove that implementations
  respect them.</li>
  <li>Reason compositionally about components and subsystems that execute
  concurrently, and that are intended to run indefinitely.</li>
  <li>Reason about systems that create and destroy seL4 kernel objects.</li>
  <li>Reflect seL4's separation guarantees into the reasoning principles of the
  logic.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  As in the seL4 verification, we write abstract specifications as programs
  shallowly embedded in an interactive theorem prover, and aim to prove
  functional correctness by  refinement. However, to describe processes that run
  indefinitely, and their interactions  with their environments, we use a
  coinductive construction in the style of interaction  trees.
</p>
<p>
  For reasoning about compositions of components and their interactions, we aim
  to  support a combination of techniques from process algebra and separation
  logic. We are  using the base logic of Iris, a concurrent separation logic
  implemented in the Rocq  Prover. However, we are building our own program
  logic, so that we can model threads  that are waiting to be unblocked or
  scheduled, as well as threads that can be deleted.
</p>
<p>
  Our framework is work in progress. In this talk, we'll describe what we have
  so far, and  our plans for further development. Currently, we are focussing on
  finding the right  concepts for verifying system safety properties up to
  functional correctness and  integrity. In future, we aim for a program logic
  that is faithful to the seL4 abstract  specification, at least for the
  subclass of system configurations of interest to Kry10.
