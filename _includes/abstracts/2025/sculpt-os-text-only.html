  The Genode operating system framework [1] is an open-source tool kit, with quarterly releases per year since 2008 [2], for building component-based operating systems. It scales from rather static embedded appliances to highly dynamic general-purpose computing as showcased by Sculpt OS.
</p>
<p>
  Sculpt OS [3][4] is an open-source general-purpose OS with two releases per year since 2018 [5]. It combines Genode's microkernel architecture, capability-based security, sandboxed device drivers, and virtual machines in a unique dynamic interactive operating system. It runs on commodity PC notebooks and ARM devices, in particular consumer focused devices like the PinePhone cellphone [6], the MNT Reform notebook [7] and on the MNT Pocket Reform mini notebook [8]. Features like on target updates and federated package provisioning of components make the Sculpt OS a enjoyable day-to-day OS for the Genode community.
</p>
<p>
  Since its inception, the Genode framework supports various microkernels, e.g. various L4 kernels, even Linux and in particular seL4 since 2015 [9]. Even so seL4 is not supported with Sculpt OS officially, it's nevertheless in reach. Is it? As part of an experimental Sculpt OS demo image [10], it became clear, that several loose ends need to be picked up [11].
</p>
<p>
  The talk will present the progress and the current state of Genode on seL4 and Sculpt OS in particular. The presentation will be given live on a Sculpt OS running on the seL4 kernel. Several typical general purpose use-cases and characteristic features of Sculpt OS will be demonstrated in order to give the audience an impression of the current interactive state of Sculpt OS on seL4.
