  seL4’s functional correctness proofs show that the kernel’s C implementation is a refinement of its abstract specification. Binary verification completes the kernel’s end-to-end functional correctness argument by showing that the compiled kernel binary is a refinement of its C implementation, providing assurance that the kernel’s security properties are satisfied all the way down to the binary level. In particular, this allows us to remove the compiler from our trusted computing base, eliminating concerns about bugs in sophisticated compiler optimization passes or differences between the compiler’s C semantics and those used by the function correctness proofs.

  seL4’s binary verification toolchain consists of three components: a verified decompiler that lifts assembly into a common interchange language called SydTV-GL; a verified translator that lowers C into SydTV-GL; and a tool that leverages SMT solvers to verify refinement between the two. The former component comes from Magnus Myreen and the HOL4 community, while the latter two come from Thomas Sewell and the seL4 community.

  In this presentation, we will explore the design of this toolchain and report on our engineering efforts, funded by the seL4 Foundation, to maintain, improve, and extend it.
