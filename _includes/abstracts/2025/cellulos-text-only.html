  Several mechanisms exist to isolate applications (e.g., processes, VMs,
  containers, lwC).
</p>
<p>
  However, there is no precise way to describe the differences in the resource
  isolation provided by each one, making it difficult to compare these
  mechanisms.
</p>
<p>
  We introduce CellulOS, a custom-built seL4-based operating system that exposes
  protection domain state in a manner that enables developers and infrastructure
  providers to reason about the resources shared between two protection domains.
  The state is exposed as proposed in the Osmosis model.
</p>
<p>
  OSmosis is a formal model that allows developers and infrastructure providers
  to reason about the resources shared between two protection domains. It
  represents resources, protection domains, and their relationships as a graph.
  Queries on this graph return sets of resources and/or protection domains,
  revealing information about confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
  Using these queries, we define a protection domainâ€™s trusted computing base,
  identifying the domains upon which it relies, and its impact boundary,
  identifying those domains affected by a faulty or malicious domain.
</p>
<p>
   The talk will cover CellulOS's architecture, the application of the OSmosis
   model to its design, its current capabilities as an OS, and how a
   capability-based uKernel facilitates the application of OSmosis to an OS. We
   will also discuss the challenges faced in bootstrapping an seL4 project from
   the perspective of a small group of graduate students, the extensive support
   provided by the seL4 community, an overview of the components we ported (VMM,
   SQLite, xv6FS, block driver), and our design for deadlock avoidance.
