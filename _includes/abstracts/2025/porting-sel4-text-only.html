  This talk presents our work porting the seL4 microkernel to a 64 bit 8-core
  RISC-V AI SoC, a high-performance RISC-V platform designed for AI
  applications. The RISC-V SoC integrates a powerful RISC-V CPU cluster with a
  dedicated NPU, making it an ideal candidate for secure and efficient AI
  workloads at the edge.We will walk through the process of bringing up seL4 on
  this platform, including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lessons learned while building seL4 on ESWIN:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Timer Incompatibility: The seL4 test TIMER0001 failed initially.
    Resolution involved explicitly disabling the timer test for
    KernelPlatformHifiveP550, as the platform lacked a complete ltimer
    implementation.
     </li>
     <li>Docker Permissions: Building the image inside the Docker environment
     required elevated privileges. The user encountered permission issues
     accessing the Docker daemon socket and fixed it via:sudo setfacl --modify
     user:$USER:rw /var/run/docker.sock
      </li>
      <li>Missing Headers (e.g., serial.h): Some platform-specific headers such
      as serial.h were not properly included. This was resolved by manually
      copying files from the HiFive-specific
      directory:projects/util_libs/libplatsupport/plat_include/hifive-p550/
      </li>
      <li>Platform Customization: The platform was not natively supported by
      upstream seL4, so additional build-time customization and patching were
      needed (e.g., modifying build scripts and manually verifying hardware
      compatibility).
      </li>
  </ul>
  <li>How was seL4 used after the port to DC-ROMA RISC-V AI PC</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Building the system using sel4test-manifest with PLATFORM=hifive-p550
    and -DRISCV64=1.</li>
    <li>Booting the seL4 test image via U-Boot on the ESWIN board using: load
    mmc 1:1 0x92000000 /kernel.dtb load mmc 1:1 0x90000000
    /sel4test-driver-image-riscv-hifive-p550 bootm 0x90000000 - 0x92000000</li>
    <li>The system booted successfully on the board, with basic functionality
    verified through seL4's standard test cases. Additionally, modifications
    were made to the CMakeLists.txt to disable the timer test on
    KernelPlatformHifiveP550, which was necessary to pass all other tests.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>
  Our goal is to enable the seL4 developer community to take advantage of modern
  RISC-V AI chips, while also opening up the RISC-V SoC to secure OS research
  and real-world deployment scenarios. The talk will include lessons learned,
  performance observations, and ideas for further collaboration with the seL4
  ecosystem.
