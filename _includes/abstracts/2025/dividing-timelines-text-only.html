  We are all familiar with the verification of the seL4 kernel, completed in
  2009, and the growth of a community of developers building systems on top of
  seL4. Many of these systems themselves contain verified components or have a
  verified design. The challenge of assembling a multi-component seL4
  application that is verified in total, to the same standard as the kernel
  itself, remains to be solved.
</p>
<p>
  A crucial part of the challenge is concurrency. The kernel is never preempted,
  and so, on a single-threaded CPU, it runs without any concurrency concerns.
  Its verification can ignore concurrency and treat kernel entry events as
  “black box” transitions from input state to output state. User level tasks
  cannot avoid concurrency. Even on a single-threaded CPU, they may be
  preempted, and exist within the appearance of a concurrent environment.
  Verification of user level tasks in context requires a concurrent semantics,
  which is much more complicated.
</p>
<p>
  This talk is about one specific aspect of the problem. We would like the user
  level concurrent semantics to mesh with the verified kernel semantics, with,
  for instance, the meaning of system calls connected to their meaning in the
  kernel API. For these purposes, the existing “black box” treatment of the
  kernel creates some complications. A system call at user level triggers a
  kernel entry, but the resulting kernel execution may perform other tasks in
  addition to handling the system call.
</p>
<p>
  We aim to address this by introducing a new variant of the seL4 abstract spec
  that splits compound events. I will report on our progress in verifying that
  the variant abstract spec is equivalent, and outline our plan to use this
  alternative specification to construct a multi-timeline system semantics.
