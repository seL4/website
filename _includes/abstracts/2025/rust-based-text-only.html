  While the seL4 microkernel provides exceptional guarantees due to its formal
  verification, that isn’t always enough on its own to meet high-assurance
  requirements. Some user applications built on top of the microkernel will need
  stronger confidence than just the known isolation from other applications.
  There are multiple ways to improve confidence in the correctness of an
  application, such as using a memory-safe language, thorough testing, and
  formal verification. I have created an seL4-based system that utilizes a
  firewall application written in Rust. The application eventually used all of
  these approaches to gain high confidence in its functional correctness.

  The system was generated with Kansas State University’s (KSU’s) HAMR toolchain
  which connects a Rust-based, low-level ethernet driver via the firewall to a
  VM. This allows for the ethernet device and driver to be fully isolated from
  the VM and for security functionality to be completely separate from the
  implementation of the VM.

  I will discuss the evolution of this system and the firewall application. I
  will discuss the benefits provided by HAMR as well as some of the challenges
  of using the tool, with special focus on the model and the GUMBO contracts
  that help formalize the requirements into specification which can be used for
  test generation and formal verification. I will provide further details about
  the property-based testing and the verification effort utilizing Verus,
  including some metrics that were gathered on the code and the effort.
