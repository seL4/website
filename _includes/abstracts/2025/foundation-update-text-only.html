  The seL4 Foundation is home to the ecosystem of software, developers and
  adopters for safety- and security-critical systems based on seL4. It was
  formed in April 2020 as a neutral and community-based organisation that
  ensures long-term, independent support for seL4 and its ecosystem, and fosters
  strong community participation and ownership in the ecosystem. It raises funds
  for continuing and accelerating development, facilitates interoperability,
  standardisation and sharing of cost for the benefit of all. Its aim is to
  ensure that seL4 is not only the world’s best secure operating-system
  technology, but is readily deployable and supported by a diverse and stable
  ecosystem of services and products.
