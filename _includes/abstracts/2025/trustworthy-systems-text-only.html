  This talk will discuss recent and on-going seL4-related research and de- velopment at UNSW’s Trustworthy Systems group. It will provide a general overview and then focus on the system side of our current work, to be com- plemented by Thomas Sewell’s and Junming Zhao’s talks that will focus on verification activities.

  Specifically this talk will cover work on kernel enhancements required for energy and thermal management, including on- and off-lining of cores and the implied migration of threads between cores. This is complemented by extensions of the Microkit.

<p>
  I will further cover or work on maturing the seL4 device driver frame-work (sDDF), including further performance improvements and new device classes, and progress on LionsOS and what we have learnt about inherent per- formance limitations (or lack thereof) of modular microkernel-based OSes.
I will also cover early-stage work on two other projects:

<ol>
  <li>Carrels: Secure micro-services on seL4, and</li>
  <li>Djawula: Provably secure, general-purpose OS on seL4.</li>
