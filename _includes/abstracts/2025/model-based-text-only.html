  The Collins Aerospace INSPECTA project (part of the DARPA PROVERS program)
  aims to provide a  model-based development tool chain for seL4 with integrated
  formal methods. The High Assurance  Modeling and Rapid engineering for
  embedded systems (HAMR) framework, whose development is led by  researchers at
  Kansas State University, is a key part of the INSPECTA tool chain. Developed
  on the  DARPA CASE project within Collins Aerospace team and on other US
  Department of Defense projects led  by Galois, HAMR originally supported
  system modeling using the SAE standard AADL modeling language.  On these
  projects, HAMR generated infrastructure code and application code thread
  skeletons in C and in  Slang (a safety-critical subset of Scala developed at
  Kansas State University). HAMR supported system  deployments on the Java
  Virtual Machine (JVM), Linux, and the seL4 micro-kernel using CAmkES. HAMR
  supported the GUMBO AADL contract language (jointly developed by KSU and
  Galois) that enabled  engineers to formally specify interface behaviors of
  AADL thread components using familiar contract-based  idioms. These
  model-level contracts were translated as part of HAMR’s code generation to
  code-level  contracts (allowing SMT-based tools to verify that user
  application code conforms to contracts) and  executable contracts (enabling
  testing frameworks to use these as test oracles and run-time monitoring to use
  them as run-time checks on thread input/output behavior).

  In this talk, we describe a number of new capabilities of HAMR developed on
  the INSPECTA project. First,  the modeling layer of HAMR has been extended to
  support SysMLv2 – a new version of the widely-used  SysML modeling language
  standardized by the Object Modeling Group (OMG). We describe how HAMR
  supported AADL-based specifications and tooling, including the GUMBO contract
  language, are being  integrated within SysMLv2 modeling environments,
  including the SysIDE extension for VSCode. Second,  we have extended HAMR’s
  code generation to support the Rust programming language and seL4 microkit.
  This provides both C and Rust-based development on seL4 with both CAmkES and
  microkit. For example,  Rust implementations of SysMLv2/AADL threads can be
  deployed in seL4 microkit protection domains,  with auto-generated microkit
  system description files and developer-facing microkit APIs for threading and
  channel communication. Finally, we have added contract generation support in
  Rust code for both formal  contracts for the Verus verification tool and Rust
  executable contracts. The talk will provide short demos  of all of these
  features – including showing Verus verification of seL4-deployed Rust thread
  component  application code conformance to HAMR-generated contracts and
  automated property-based testing of Rust  thread component code against
  HAMR-generated executable contracts.

    These new capabilities of HAMR are being applied by Dornerworks and Collins
    Aerospace engineers on  military applications including mission control
    software for UAVs.

  HAMR is available under an open-source license, and the project website
  includes an example repository and collection of videos, tutorials, and
  classroom lecture materials (also suited for workforce training).
