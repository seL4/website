  Device driver bugs are the leading cause of OS compromises, and their formal
  verification is therefore highly desirable. To the best of our knowledge, no
  realistic  and performant driver has been verified for a non-trivial device.
</p>
<p>
  In 2024 seL4 Summit, we introduced Pancake, an imperative language for system
  programming that features a verified compiler and a well-defined, verification
  friendly semantics. We now have integrated Pancake into Viper SMT verification
  infrastructure via an automatic transpiler to establish end-to-end functional
  correctness for Pancake programs. We have formally verified a performant
  real-world  Ethernet driver using this framework.

<p>
  In this talk, we present the driver verification workflow, Viper front-end
  encodings  for Pancake, the verified device driver performance and the future
  challenges to  extend the framework to other seL4-based system components.
