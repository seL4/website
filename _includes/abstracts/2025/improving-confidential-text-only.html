  n the realm of Confidential Computing, the advent of technologies such as AMD
  SEV-SNP, Intel TDX, Arm CCA, and RISC-V COVE introduces essential protection
  capabilities to the cloud. While these innovations significantly bolster VM
  security against hypervisors, communication endpoints of the VMs still leave
  an open attack surface for malicious actors. Traditional monolithic guest
  OSes, particularly Linux, exacerbate these risks due to their large code size
  and kernel-space drivers, which are attractive targets for attackers. Drivers
  in the Linux kernel generally treat the hardware/hypervisor to be trustworthy
  and don't consider that path in the attacker model.

  This talk proposes the use of seL4, a microkernel with user-space drivers, as
  a more suitable guest OS for Confidential VMs (CVMs). With its small code size
  and formal verification, seL4 presents a robust alternative that reduces the
  attack surface.

  The current state of the endeavor for one specific technology will be
  discussed, as well as remaining tasks, potential use-cases and possible steps
  forward.
