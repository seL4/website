CantripOS is an open source operating system purpose-built to run ML workloads for embedded systems. It is being developed as part of Googleâ€™s project Sparrow, whose charter is to build a low-power embedded platform for ML applications with a focus on security and privacy. CantripOS is built in the Rust programming language1, runs under the seL4 microkernel2, and uses a modified CAmkES framework3. This allows CantripOS to run dynamically loaded applications in a controlled sandbox, while still retaining the benefits of a statically designed system. This paper describes the system design, modifications made to seL4 and CAmkES, and future directions. All the work described here is publicly available on GitHub4.
