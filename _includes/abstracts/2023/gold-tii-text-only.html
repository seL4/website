In today's digital age, when cyber threats are everywhere, the importance of building robust and secure systems cannot be overstated. This presentation dives deep into the initiatives undertaken by the Secure Systems Research Center (SSRC). We'll shed light on our collaborations, projects, and the novel solutions we've pioneered to tackle pressing cyber challenges. The SSRC is a pillar among the ten research centers that comprise the Technology Innovation Institute (TII). Situated in Abu Dhabi, TII aims to lead the way in tech research, focusing on critical areas in the digital world today. In this presentation, we will discuss our latest work and how tools like the seL4 microkernel help make our systems even more secure. By the end of this session, attendees will gain a panoramic view of SSRC's achievements over the past year. We'll also offer a glimpse into the future, outlining our strategic plans and emphasizing SSRC's commitment to pushing the barriers of tech security.
