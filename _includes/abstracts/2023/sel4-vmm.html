    The royalty-free, open-source RISC-V is an ideal ISA for the high-assurance seL4 microkernel since the formal proof requires definitive understanding of its underlying architecture. DornerWorks’ use-case generally utilizes virtualization with seL4 to provide a secure platform which allows for cyber-retrofit, rapid deployment, and cyber resilience. Virtualization is an area where RISC-V is immature. The hypervisor (H) extension has been ratified, but there are still no commercially available silicon processors that support the extension. The Rocket Chip is a soft-core RISC-V implementation which can be instantiated on an FPGA and is essentially equivalent to a real silicon processor. DornerWorks bridged the gap between the seL4 VMM running on QEMU and running on actual silicon by getting a seL4 VMM running, for the first time, on a Rocket Chip instantiation which has the hypervisor extensions implemented. This presentation will provide an overview of the Rocket Chip, the RISC-V H extension, the effort that went into getting the seL4 VMM to run on Rocket Chip, and thoughts on the next steps for seL4 virtualization on RISC-V platforms.
