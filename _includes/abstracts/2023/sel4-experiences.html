Sandboxing legacy code provides a low barrier approach for developers to start implementing systems in the seL4 ecosystem. However, these legacy applications often need to communicate with each other to function properly. seL4 provides a means of communication between virtual machines via a software implementation of an ethernet device called virtio-net, which currently suffers from performance and stability problems. These performance and stability issues present a barrier to adoption of seL4 for multiple markets. DornerWorks will present an overview of the seL4 virtio-net implementation, the challenges using it, how DornerWorks improved it in the mainline, and performance benchmarks which include our IP solution to increase performance by a factor of 40.
