    The Rust programming language and ecosystem offer memory safety and developer productivity even at lower levels of the software stack. There are numerous efforts within the seL4 community towards laying groundwork for an accessible development story for Rust in the seL4 userspace. This talk explores the technical considerations related to Rust in the seL4 userspace, surveys the accomplishments and directions of these efforts, and then calls for the participation of interested parties in the ongoing design and implementation of Rust support in the upstream seL4 software ecosystem.
