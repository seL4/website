    With TRENTOS, HENSOLDT Cyber develops a novel secure embedded OS on top of the proven seL4 ecosystem. The CAmkES framework is hereby utilized for providing the respective abstraction layer on top of seL4, which allows for constructing respective OS components and services (e.g. for storage or networking support) within TRENTOS. As part of this workshop, participants shall therefore get to know the general TRENTOS architecture, its basic building blocks as well as the standard TRENTOS operating system components. Finally, with the help of the TRENTOS SDK, a small TRENTOS application will be developed and the corresponding build and deployment process will be demonstrated.
