    Since the winter term 2020, the practical course "seL4 & TRENTOS" offers students at the TUM an introduction into the fundamental aspects of TRENTOS, a novel secure embedded operating system developed by HENSOLDT Cyber, which is built on top of the seL4 microkernel and the CAmkES framework. The course starts with a respective theory phase, in which students get to know the basic building blocks of both kernel and user space. Afterwards, the course participants work within teams on an individual practical project. They hereby apply a TRENTOS-based setup, running on top of the the Raspberry Pi platform, to a selected real-world use case (e.g. originating from the domains automotive or industrial automation). Besides providing a general course overview, this talk shall therefore demonstrate respective course results and serve as a starting point for follow-up discussions.
