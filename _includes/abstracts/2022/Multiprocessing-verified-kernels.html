        Verified multicore seL4 seem too far away? Think again, this talk presents a simple multikernel approach to achieve this goal that is attainable using the verified unicore kernel we already have. While this solution does not provide all the benefits of a single system image it allows us to build static systems on a verified seL4 using multiple cores today. This talk will detail how to construct such a system, the work involved and examples of how it can be used.
