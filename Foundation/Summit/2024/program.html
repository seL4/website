      Using LionsOS
    </strong></p>

      LionsOS is a new Operating Systems developed at Trustworthy Systems aimed at embedded, IoT, and cyberphysical
      systems. LionsOS is based on the seL4 Microkit and is desgined to formally verifiable, performant, and adaptable
      to a wide class of use-cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      LionsOS, by design, is not a conventional OS and hence it may be overwhelming for users who want to get started
      and are not familiar with the ideas and goals of LionsOS.
    </p>
    <p>
      This hands-on tutorial aims to ease people into creating a LionsOS-based system. We will be using the components
      and tools provided by LionsOS to, step-by-step, transform a minimal boilerplate system to a functional system
      involving various drivers, virtual machines and other components.

      Using Rust in seL4 Userspace

      Rust has been an officially supported language for use in seL4 userspace since last year&apos;s summit. In this
      workshop, participants will be led through a tutorial that demonstrates how to leverage Rust and its ecosystem
      to rapidly build memory-safe components for seL4-based systems. This tutorial will cover a range of scenarios,
      including <a href="https://docs.sel4.systems/projects/microkit/">Microkit</a> protection domains as well as
      building on seL4 directly.
