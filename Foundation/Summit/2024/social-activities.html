  <p>
    The plan is to walk
    from <a href="https://www.scenicworld.com.au">Scenic World</a>
    down the Furber Steps along Federal Pass (underneath
    the <a href="https://www.bluemts.com.au/info/thingstodo/threesisters/">Three
    Sisters</a>), up Amphitheatre Track, past
    the <a href="https://www.walkmyworld.com/posts/leura-cascades/">Leura
      Cascades</a> and end up at Leura Cascades picknick area.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Itinerary:</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>08:15</strong> meet at Central Station <s>Platform 5</s>
      <strong style="color:red">Platform 18</strong> to
      take the <s>8:24 train to Lithgow, arrive Katoomba
      10:29</s> <strong style="color:red">8:21 train to Hornsby, arrive Katoomba
      10:54</strong> (with changing to a bus and back to train in between).<br/> For
      those staying at the Summit venue (Potts Point Holiday Inn),
      King's Cross station is practically next door.
      Take the 07:54 train to Cronulla (or any train going towards the
      city, the train after should still be fine if you hurry up), it's three
      stops to Central.<br/> You can use any credit card to swipe
      yourself through the gates. At Central follow the signs to
      Platform 5 (don't go through any swipe gates!)
    </li>
    <li>
      From Katoomba station we'll take the bus or taxis to Scenic World (2.5km).
    </li>
    <li>
      The actual walk is 6km and should take less than two hours walking time
      (practically it'll be more like three as there are nice views on
      the way). Total descent (steep but easy track, plus some stairs)
      is 370m, total ascent (steep-ish but also easy track) is 320m.
    </li>
    <li>
      From Leura Cascades Picnic Area we'll take taxis to Leura
      Station (or 25' walk if you haven't had enough).
    </li>
    <li>
      Train back to Central departs twice an hour (x:26 and x:41) and
      takes two hours.
    </li>
    <li>
      Back at Central sometime between 16:30 and 19:30.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong>
    The <a href="https://www.theweathernetwork.com/en/city/au/new-south-wales/katoomba/14-days/">weather
    forecast</a> from this distance (4
    October) isn't great, we have to expect rain, but it shouldn't be
    so bad that we can't go. But keep in mind that the track may be
    muddy in places, so don't take your best shoes!

    <strong>Important:</strong> Let <a title="gernot@unsw.edu.au"
         href="mailto:gernot@unsw.edu.au">Gernot</a>
    know if you're coming so we can make sure we've
    got everyone when we take the train!

        <s>Bookings are required by <span class="highlight">4 October 2024</span>.</s>

    <p>
        Unfortunately we didn’t reach the minimum group size of 12 for a private tour of The Rocks. (The company was going to organise one just for the seL4 group.)

        But as we had a few people interested, we’ll be joining a Daily Tour on <span class="highlight">10:30 am, Monday 14 Oct</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Bookings can be made directly through <a href="https://www.rockswalkingtours.com.au/walking-tour/">The Rocks Walking Tour</a>. The cost is $40 AUD pp instead of the $35 that we had negotiated.
    </p>
    <p>
        We’re also going for lunch in the CBD afterwards.
