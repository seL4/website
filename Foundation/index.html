        The seL4 Foundation provides a long-term, independent support for the
        seL4 kernel and the seL4 ecosystem, by enabling the collaborative
        community-based development, availability and adoption of the seL4
        kernel. The seL4 Foundation aims to represent the perspectives of all
        main actors of the seL4 community (kernel developers, kernel verifiers,
        ecosystem developers and adopters) in the technical and general
        governance of the seL4 kernel and the&nbsp;seL4 Foundation.
