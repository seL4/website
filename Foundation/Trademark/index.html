  The Linux Foundation has registered seL4<sup>&reg;</sup> as a
  trademark in the United States and other countries. Please use &reg;
  with the first mention of seL4 in all materials. In addition to the
  guidelines below, the Trademark Usage Guidelines of the LF Projects, LLC,
  available at
  <a href="https://lfprojects.org/policies/trademark-policy/">https://lfprojects.org/policies/trademark-policy/</a>,
  also apply to any use of the seL4 trademarks and logos.

<h2 id="needed-approvals">Needed Approvals</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    You <strong>may not</strong> use the seL4 marks in domain names
    for products, events, or services related to the seL4 microkernel
    without prior approval. Obtain approval
    via <a href="mailto:trademark@sel4.systems" class="email">trademark@sel4.systems</a>.</li>

<h2 id="marketing-materials-and-press-releases">Marketing Materials and Press Releases</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>We recommend</strong>, if you prepare marketing
    collateral, training material, or press releases that use the seL4
    mark, that you submit these
    to <a href="mailto:trademark@sel4.systems" class="email">trademark@sel4.systems</a> for discussion and
    approval.

<h2 id="compliance-rules">Compliance Rules</h2>
<p>
  The usage guidelines
  at <a href="https://lfprojects.org/policies/trademark-policy/">https://lfprojects.org/policies/trademark-policy/</a>
  apply to the seL4 mark and logos. In addition:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Do not</strong> modify the seL4 trademark or logos, e.g., do
  not add other characters, or change the colors, orientation or any
  other visual aspect of any logos.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Do not</strong> use the seL4 trademark in a misleading
  way. This includes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Do not</strong> use the seL4 mark to refer to code that
    is modified in any way from the repository
    at <a href="http://github.com/seL4/seL4" class="uri">http://github.com/seL4/seL4</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>You may</strong> use the seL4 mark to refer to the seL4
    microkernel, the seL4 Foundation, or the seL4 proofs if you use
    them accurately. The seL4 microkernel refers to the master branch
    of the code hosted
    at <a href="https://github.com/seL4/seL4" class="uri">https://github.com/seL4/seL4</a>. The seL4 proofs
    refer to the formal mathematical proofs hosted
    at <a href="https://github.com/seL4/l4v" class="uri">https://github.com/seL4/l4v</a>.
    <br>
    For any
    modified versions make clear it is a modification of seL4, not
    seL4 itself; for academic research modifications you may use the
    term <em>experimental seL4</em>.<br /> Cloning the repository,
    working on features, modifications, evaluations, research, etc,
    and referring to these is fine and encouraged. The purpose of the
    restriction is to ensure clarity and consistency on what the mark
    refers to. When referring to modifications and work-in-progress on
    the seL4 kernel, the name seL4 should refer to the official seL4
    code from the foundation repository. Therefore examples
    of <strong>incorrect</strong> use are:
    <ul>
      <li>company Y's seL4 with feature X</li>
      <li>enhanced seL4 with feature X</li>
    </ul>
    Examples of <strong>correct</strong> use are (where accurate):
    <ul>
      <li>
        feature X by company Y is under review for inclusion into the
        seL4 kernel
      </li>
      <li>
        feature X developed by company Y is under review to be
        included in the next release of the seL4 kernel
      </li>
      <li>
        feature X by company Y is on the roadmap to be included in the seL4 kernel
      </li>
      <li>
        company Y has developed a modification X to the seL4 kernel and has
        evaluated its performance/impact/benefits.
      </li>
      <li>
        company Y is working on feature X to be included in the seL4 kernel
      </li>
    </ul>
    The important difference between <em>xyz seL4</em> and <em>a
      modification to seL4</em> is that in the former (incorrect) use
    of the mark refers to the modified version, and in the latter
    (correct) use of the mark refers to the code in the foundation
    repository.<br>
    For use in academic research publications only,
    the foundation allows the use of the forms <em>experimental
      seL4</em> and <em>experimental version of seL4</em> for referring
    to modifications to the seL4 code that are experimental research
    code. The form is explicitly meant for modifications that are not
    ready for commercial use, and not checked or endorsed by the
    foundation. An example of correct such use in a research paper
    would be “running on an experimental version of seL4 that supports
    feature X”.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Do not</strong> use the seL4 mark to make misleading
    claims about the strength and completeness of its formal
    verification. In particular, do not claim configurations of seL4
    to be formally verified when they are not, and do not claim
    properties to be verified that are not. See the source code
    repository for which configurations are verified. If unsure,
    contact <a href="mailto:trademark@sel4.systems" class="email">trademark@sel4.systems</a>. We will be happy to
    review and help phrase formal verification claims.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>You may only</strong> make use of formal verification
    claims of seL4 in relation with your product if your product
    actually uses a verified configuration of seL4.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Do not</strong> add your company logo(s) to seL4
    Foundation training and marketing materials, such as official
    presentations, unless expressly permitted to do so by the seL4
    Foundation.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Do not</strong> create marketing or training materials
    that look as if they come from the seL4 Foundation rather than
    your company.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Do not</strong> present the seL4 logos or marks larger
    than your own company's logo(s).
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="naming-open-source-projects">Naming Open Source Projects</h2>
<p>
  For many libraries and language bindings it makes sense to include
  the seL4 mark in the name of your project.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>You may</strong> do so in the following forms. <strong>Do</strong>
  use a capital L in seL4:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>&lt;project&gt;-for-seL4</li>
  <li>&lt;language&gt;-seL4-bindings</li>
  <li>&lt;language&gt;-libseL4</li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>Do not</strong> use e.g. seL4-&lt;project&gt; or
  seL4-&lt;language&gt;-bindings.
</p>
<p>
  If for some reason a different form is preferable, this can often be
  accommodated. To use such a different form, obtain written
  permission from <a href="mailto:trademark@sel4.systems" class="email">trademark@sel4.systems</a>.
</p>
<p>
  If your project is a generally useful part of the ecosystem of
  components, libraries, and frameworks around the seL4 kernel,
  consider hosting it under the seL4 Foundation GitHub organisation
  at <a href="https://github.com/seL4/">github.com/seL4</a>. Contact
  one of the members of the <a href="../TSC/">TSC</a> of the
  foundation if you would like to do so with a description of the
  project, its current state and plans for the future.
</p>
<p>
  Projects and repositories hosted under the seL4 Foundation GitHub
  organisation may use the seL4 mark more freely in their name.
