 Information about the endorsement scheme
</h1>

<p>
  The type of services that the member has expertise on and is being endorsed for, are described in detail, and taken from a template list of services, namely:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>systems: kernel</li>
  <li>systems: kernel platform ports</li>
  <li>systems: user-level OS</li>
  <li>systems: applications</li>
  <li>verification: kernel</li>
  <li>verification: user-level OS</li>
  <li>verification: applications</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Endorsement in one of the category above means that the member has one or multiple people in-house who have that expertise and have already contributed in this area. This is reviewed annually.
</p>
<p>
  Each category can have qualifiers/examples, which can be suggested by the member, eg "user-level OS (VM)” or “user-level OS (CAMkES).”
</p>
<p>
  The endorsement of services is limited to members and provided for free.

  </p>

  <p style="padding-top:10px">
    The Foundation is working on developing <strong>endorsement</strong>
    schemes for services, training and products.
    Until these are in place, we provide <strong>interim endorsements</strong>.
    All (interim) endorsed training modules and services are advertised <a href="home.html">here</a>.
    Interim endorsements are provided for free and to Foundation members only.
    More info  <a href="home.html">here</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Services</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <span class=emph><strong>To request interim endorsement:</strong></span>
      Contact

    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Guidelines</strong>:
      <ul>
  <li>
    The (for now, interim) endorsement indicates
    that a particular <strong>service provider has the skills and experience
      to provide high-quality services to adopters of seL4 </strong>.
  </li>
  <li>
    The interim endorsement of an seL4 service provider is awarded based on an assessment that the provider is:
    <ul>
      <li>
        known and respected in the seL4 Community;
      </li>
      <li>
        has demonstrated technical competence in the development of code
        or proofs of the seL4 kernel or software components running
        directly the seL4 kernel or tools supporting the development of
        seL4-based systems;
      </li>
      <li>
        has a track record of contributions to the seL4 ecosystem.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
      </ul>
  </ul>

  <h2>Training</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>

          <a title="foundation@sel4.systems"
             href= "mailto:foundation@sel4.systems">
      foundation@sel4.systems</a>
    <strong>at least 3 weeks before sending the actual
      training material</strong>;
  </li>
  <li>
    Within two weeks of sending the material, you will receive the Foundation's assessment, which may be:
    <ul>
      <li>
        either an unconditional interim endorsement,
      </li>
      <li>
        or a conditional interim endorsement subject to some required changes,
      </li>
      <li>
        or a list of recommended changes for a revised submission.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    The assessment may be based on presentation material
    alone but may also include an examination of any code provided for
    hands-on training, at the discretion of the Foundation.
  </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Guidelines</strong>:
      <ul>
  <li>
    The (for now, interim) endorsement indicates
    that a particular <strong>training is of high quality and effective
      in providing useful skills for deploying the seL4 microkernel</strong>.
  </li>
  <li>
    The interim endorsement of an seL4 training module will be
    awarded based on an assessment of the training material
    (presentation material and potentially code used in hands-on
    training sessions), to ensure that:
    <ul>
      <li>
        it is technically correct and of sufficient depth and breadth
      </li>
      <li>
        it is compliant with the Foundation's Trademark Guidelines.

    on the category of the product. The different categories of
    seL4 products include:

        driver, authentication service)
