      Cog has been preparing for the revolution in connected device
      architecture since 2017. The traditional architecture of IoT and
      other connected devices has created innumerable opportunities
      for bad actors to compromise the device, thereby forcing
      security policy to accept higher risk and restricted access,
      which in turn poses a burden on users. We have adopted an
      embedded solution set, leveraging seL4, built on modularity,
      proactive security, trustworthiness, and adaptability to enable
      highly secure connected devices.<br>

      As the leading integrator of type-1 visualization solutions
      based on seL4, Cog leverages modularity to isolate critical
      functions and services on connected devices. This approach
      pro-actively secures these devices by reducing the attack
      surface and increases reliability by eliminating single points
      of failure. Cog focuses on securing the kernel, data, and
      network as the baseline to our security. Additionally, we can
      isolate specific applications, operating systems, drivers, or
      services to further achieve a full defense in depth based
      solution. The system can scale linearly and infinitely, thus
      reducing bottlenecks and preserving performance. All of this is
      available for the IoT market with the flexibility to run all
      applications effectively and securely.<br>
