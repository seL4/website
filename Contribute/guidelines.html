<h3>We welcome contributions to all aspects of the seL4 ecosystem:</h3>

<ul>
  <li class="list-tick">Code and documentation contributions via pull requests on
    <a href="https://github.com/seL4">GitHub</a>. You should be aware of the seL4
    <a href="{% link Contribute/conventions.html %}">coding conventions and
    requirements</a> and the <a href="dco.html">developer certificate of
    origin</a>.  See <a href="#code">more details below.</a>
  </li>
  <li class="list-tick">Design and API contributions via the
    <a href="{% link Contribute/rfc-process.md %}">Request for Comments (RFC) process</a></li>
  <li class="list-tick">Asking questions and helping out others on
    <a href="{% link support.html %}">our community channels</a></li>
</ul>

The <a href="{% link Contribute/conduct.md %}">seL4 code of conduct</a> applies
to all contributions.


<h2 id="code">Code, Proofs, and Documentation</h2>

<p>
  Code, proof, and documentation contributions are via pull requests on
  repositories in the <a href="https://github.com/seL4">seL4 GitHub org</a>. To
  increase the likelihood that your pull request receives interest and reviews,
  please follow the guidelines on the page for
  <a href="{% link Contribute/conventions.html %}">coding conventions and
  requirements</a>. The <a href="dco.html">developer certificate of origin</a>
  requirement applies to all pull requests, including documentation and proof
  contributions.
</p>
<p>In general, quality assurance requirements are highest for kernel
contributions. They are more standard and faster-paced for user-level frameworks
and libraries.</p>
<p>
  Note that larger changes, such as an architecture port, or adding a new
  feature to the kernel, requires a
  <a href="{% link Contribute/rfc-process.md %}">RFC</a> first, in which you
  describe the change and
  get feedback from the community. Contributions to user-level frameworks and
  libraries are less formal, but we still recommend that you discuss any larger
  contributions <a href="{% link support.html %}">with the community</a>
  before starting work on them.
</p>

<p>
  Anyone can help review pull requests, but only people that have been granted the
  <a href="{% link Contribute/roles.md %}">Committer</a> role by the
  <a href="{% link Foundation/TSC/index.html %}">Technical Steering
  Committee</a> can merge them. Committers are the people responsible for maintaining
  the quality and correctness of the code.
</p>


<p>
  For the specific case of contributing a platform port, please read
  the <a href="{% link Contribute/platform-ports.md %}">platform contributions
  guide</a>.
  The <a href="https://docs.sel4.systems">seL4 docsite</a> has additional
  guidance for <a
  href="https://docs.sel4.systems/projects/sel4/kernel-contribution.html">kernel
  contributions</a>, as well as <a
  href="https://docs.sel4.systems/processes/docs-contributing.html">guidance</a>
  for contributing to the docsite itself.
